    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>OUNG Doctor
      Dearing sat in the little church at an open window through which he had a
      partial view of that portion of old Stafford which stretched out
      desultorily toward the east. Immediately in front was a common fairly well
      covered with grass and weeds, except at the pawed and beaten spot where
      the public hitched its riding-horses, and beyond stood rows of
      old-fashioned residences of brick and stone, interspersed with a few
      modern frame cottages which, in gaudy paint, thrust themselves nearer the
      street than their more stately neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a Sunday morning, and the smile of a balmy spring day lay over
      every visible object, filling the ambient air with a translucent message
      that no human mind could interpret. It was as though an infinite God were
      speaking to eyes and ears too coarsely fashioned to fully see and hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole was conducive to the doctor's feeling of restfulness and content
      and good-will to every human being. He liked the young minister who was
      seated in the high-backed rosewood chair behind the white pulpit, holding
      a massive Bible on his slender knees, a look of consecration to a sacred
      cause in his brown eyes. There was an assuring augury that spoke well for
      the youth of the town in the spectacle of the choir&mdash;the young men in
      their best clothes, and the young women in their flower-like dresses and
      plumed and ribboned hats.
    </p>
    <p>
      His gaze was drawn perforce to the face of the young organist, who sat
      staring listlessly over the top of her hymn-book. She had a face and form
      of rare beauty and grace. Her features were most regular; her skin clear;
      her eyes were large, long-lashed, dreamy, and of the color of violets. Her
      hair was a living mass of silken bronze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looks tired and worried,&rdquo; was Dearing's half-professional comment.
      &ldquo;Perhaps her mother is worse, and she sat up last night. Poor Dora! she
      has certainly had a lot to contend with since her father died. I'll wait
      for her after church and ask about her mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The service over, he made his way through the throng down the aisle toward
      the door. He was quite popular, and there was many a hand to shake and
      many a warm greeting to respond to, but he finally succeeded in reaching a
      point in the shaded church-yard which Dora Barry would pass on her way
      home, and there he waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some unaccountable reason she was almost the last to leave the church,
      and the congregation had well-nigh dispersed when he saw her coming. He
      noticed that she kept her glance on the ground, and that her step was slow
      and languid; he was all but sure, too, that he heard her sigh, and he saw
      her firm round breast heave tremulously as she neared him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Dora,&rdquo; he said, cheerily; and she started as, for the first
      time, she noticed his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed, a flush forcing itself into the pallor of her really
      exquisite face. &ldquo;I thought&mdash;that is, I didn't expect to&mdash;to see
      you here, and, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been watching you this morning instead of the preacher,&rdquo; he said,
      with a boyish laugh, &ldquo;and I made up my mind that I'll have to take you in
      hand. You are burning the candle at both ends, and there is a fire-cracker
      in the middle. What is the use of being your family doctor if I let you
      get down sick, when I can prevent it by raking you over the coals? How is
      your mother? You had to be up last night&mdash;I can see it by the streaks
      under your eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I wasn't up,&rdquo; the girl answered. The color had receded from her
      cheeks, and the abstracted expression which he had noticed in the church
      began to repossess her wondrous eyes. &ldquo;She is not quite well yet, but she
      did not call me at all through the night. Your last prescription did her
      good; it soothed her pain, and she rested better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm going to walk home with you and stop in and see her, to make
      sure,&rdquo; he answered, still lightly. &ldquo;If you don't look out you will be down
      yourself. Two sick persons in a family of two wouldn't be any fun.&rdquo; She
      made no response; her eyes had a far-off look in their shadowy depths, and
      as he walked along beside her he eyed her profile curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I declare, Dora,&rdquo; he said, half jestingly, &ldquo;you don't seem
      overjoyed to have a fellow's company. Of course, I'm not a ladies' man,
      and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Wynn.&rdquo; She looked up anxiously, and her lip trembled as she
      suppressed another sigh. &ldquo;It wasn't that I didn't want you to come. You
      know better than to accuse me of such a thing. I have always considered
      you the best, kindest, and truest friend I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only joking,&rdquo; he responded, touched by the undoubted sincerity of
      her tone and manner; &ldquo;but, really, I don't like to see my little neighbor
      looking so glum, and I am going to stop in and see how your mother is. If
      she needs a trained nurse I'll get one, or come over and look after her
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the cottage where Dora lived. It was small, and stood in
      a diminutive but rather pretty flower-garden on a short, little used
      street immediately behind Dearing's home. And when he had opened the
      sagging gate in the white paling fence, she preceded him into the low,
      vine-grown porch, and narrow, box-like hallway, from which she led him
      into the parlor, the room opposite to the chamber of the sick woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, won't you?&rdquo; Dora said, in a weary tone, as she began to
      unfasten her hat. &ldquo;I'll tell her you are here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a seat in the bowed window of the plainly furnished room, and she
      brought a palm-leaf fan to him. &ldquo;I'm sure my mother won't keep you waiting
      long.&rdquo; And with the look of abstraction deepening on her mobile face, she
      turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A neat matting made of green and brown straw covered the floor, on which
      were placed rugs made of scraps of silk of various colors artistically
      blended. A carved rosewood table with a white marble top stood in the
      centre of the room, and on it rested a plush-covered photograph-album, a
      glass lamp with a fluted and knotched paper shade on a frame of wire, and
      a vase of freshly cut flowers. Between the two front windows, which, like
      their fellows, were draped in white lace curtains of the cheapest quality,
      stood Dora's piano&mdash;a small, square instrument with sloping octagonal
      legs and lyre-shaped pedal-support. Against the wall near by leaned a
      time-worn easel, on which lay some torn and ragged sketches, a besmeared
      palette, and a handful of stubby, paint-filled brushes. The ceiling
      overhead was made of planks and painted light blue; the walls were
      plastered and whitewashed and ornamented by some really good family
      portraits in oil which had been done by Dora's deceased father, who had
      been the town's only artist. A Seth Thomas clock presided over a crude
      mantelpiece which was bare of any other ornament. The deep chimney was
      filled with pine-tops and cones, the uneven bricks of the hearth were
      whitewashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dearing heard the girl's returning step in the hallway, and then she
      looked in on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is sitting up,&rdquo; Dora announced. &ldquo;She wants you to come to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he entered the room across the hall Dora turned toward the kitchen in
      the rear, and he found himself facing her mother, a thin, gaunt woman
      about fifty years of age, who sat in a low rocking-chair near her bed, the
      latter orderly arranged under a spotlessly white coverlet and great snowy
      pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not a professional visit, Mrs. Barry.&rdquo; He smiled as he bent to
      take her thin, nervous hand, the fingers of which were aimlessly picking
      at the fringe on the arm of the chair. &ldquo;Dora was headed for home, and so
      was I. The truth is, I am not half so much worried about you as I am about
      her. Your color is coming back fast enough, and you have no fever. You are
      all right, but she looks upset and nervous. It may be due to her highly
      artistic temperament, which is a thing medicine can't easily reach. Do you
      know if her appetite is good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really I haven't noticed about that particularly,&rdquo; the woman answered, in
      a plaintive tone. &ldquo;You see, since I got down I haven't been about the
      dining-room at all. She has waited on me instead of me on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you'll be all right in a day or so,&rdquo; Dearing said, his brows drawn
      thoughtfully, &ldquo;and then you can take charge of her. She declares, though,
      that her health is tip-top.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old patient folded her thin, blue-veined hands tightly for a moment,
      and twisted them spasmodically together; then suddenly she fixed her
      sharp, gray eyes anxiously on the young man's face, and he saw that she
      was deeply moved, for her lower lip was twitching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always felt that you are the one young man whom I could trust&mdash;absolutely
      trust,&rdquo; she said, falteringly. &ldquo;Physicians are supposed to keep certain
      matters to themselves, anyway, but even aside from that, Wynn, it is hard
      to keep from speaking to you in a familiar way, having seen you grow up
      from babyhood right under my eyes, so I hope you will forgive me if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I wouldn't have you quit calling me that for the world!&rdquo; Dearing
      flushed deeply and laughed. &ldquo;I haven't grown a full beard yet to make me
      look older and wiser than I am, as many young sawbones do. I hope I'll
      always be simply Wynn Dearing to you, Mrs. Barry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked as admiringly and as proudly as a mother might at the strong,
      smooth-shaved face, with its merry eyes of brown, firm chin and mouth, and
      shock of thick, dark hair, and at the tall, muscular frame and limbs in
      the neatly cut suit of brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I can trust you,&rdquo; she muttered, her voice growing husky, &ldquo;and it
      seems to me if I don't confide in some one, I may as well give up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what is the matter, Mrs. Barry?&rdquo; Dearing inquired, now quite grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is about Dora!&rdquo; The old woman sighed. &ldquo;Wynn, I may as well confess
      it. My sickness is partly due to worry over her. It is not because she is
      unwell either. It is something else. I am afraid she has some&mdash;some
      secret trouble. You must not show that you suspect anything&mdash;that
      would never do; but all is not as it should be with her. Naturally she has
      as happy a disposition as any girl I ever knew. Her art pupils adore her,
      and up to quite recently she used to laugh and joke with them constantly;
      but she has altered&mdash;strangely altered. I catch her sitting by
      herself at times with the saddest, most woebegone expression on her face.
      When I try to worm it out of her, she attempts to laugh it off; but she
      can't keep up the pretense, and it is not long before she begins to droop
      again. Her room is there, you see; and as the partition is thin, I often
      wake up in the dead of night and hear her cautiously tiptoeing over the
      floor&mdash;first to the window and then back to her bed, as though she
      were unable to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is bad,&rdquo; Dearing said, sympathetically, as Mrs. Barry paused and,
      covering her wrinkled face with her hands, remained silent for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to ask you something,&rdquo; the old woman continued, hesitatingly&mdash;&ldquo;something
      of a personal nature. I have no earthly right to do such a thing, but I
      thought, you see, that it might help me decide whether I am right in
      something I fear. Is it true that&mdash;that your uncle has forbidden Fred
      Walton to visit your sister Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dearing shrugged his broad shoulders and contracted his heavy brows. &ldquo;I
      may as well tell you that he has, Mrs. Barry. I don't like to speak
      against another young man, and one who has never harmed me in any way; but
      I agree with my uncle that Fred is not exactly the kind of man I'd like to
      have Madge make an intimate friend of. His general character is not what
      it ought to be, and he seems to be going from bad to worse. He still has
      plenty of friends and even sympathizers, who think Fred would reform and
      settle down to business if his father were not quite so hard on him. Madge
      is one of them. She has a sort of girlish faith in the fellow, and the
      slightest word against him makes her mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is about Fred Walton that I want to speak to you,&rdquo; Mrs. Barry
      resumed, tremulously. &ldquo;He has been coming to see Dora a good deal for the
      last year. He passes by the gate often in the afternoon, and they take
      long walks over the hills to the river. Sometimes he accompanies her when
      she goes to sketch in the woods. And now and then she slips out after
      dark, and won't say where she has been. You see, I am speaking very
      frankly. I <i>have</i> to, Wynn, for I am in great trouble&mdash;greater
      than I ever thought could come to me at my time of life. My child is an
      orphan, and there is no one, you see, to&mdash;to protect her. It is hard
      to think that any man here at home could be so&mdash;so dishonorable, but
      they all say he is reckless, and&mdash;well, if I must say it&mdash;I am
      afraid she cares a great deal about him. I may be very wrong, and I hope I
      am, but I am deeply troubled, and need not try to hide it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see how you feel,&rdquo; Dearing said, his face hardening as he bit his lip,
      and a fixed stare came into his eyes, &ldquo;but I am sure you have nothing very&mdash;very
      serious to fear. Dora may think she cares for him. He seems to have a
      wonderful way with women, young and old. They all stand by him and make
      excuses for his daredevil ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I do hope I am wrong,&rdquo; Mrs. Barry said, brightening a little. &ldquo;It
      has made me feel better to talk to you. We'll wait and see. As you say, it
      may be only a fancy on Dora's part, and it may all come out right. I have
      said more to you, Wynn, than I could have said to any one else in the
      world. That shows how much confidence I place in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can trust me, Mrs. Barry,&rdquo; Dearing said, as he looked at his watch
      and rose to go. &ldquo;I know how to keep my mouth shut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he was leaving, Dora stood motionless at the window of her room, hidden
      from his view by the curtains. She watched him as he passed out of the
      yard and crossed the narrow street to reach the rear gate to his own
      grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he knew the truth he'd despise me!&rdquo; she moaned, as she sank into a
      chair and tensely clasped her little hands in her lap. &ldquo;How can I bear it?
      I'm so miserable&mdash;so very, very miserable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose, and went to her bureau, and took up a photograph of Fred Walton;
      as she gazed at it her eyes filled and her lip quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear Fred!&rdquo; she said, fervently, &ldquo;in spite of all the faults they
      say you have, you are the best and truest friend a poor girl ever had. If
      I'd only listened to your advice I'd never have been like this. Oh, what
      will you think when you hear the truth&mdash;the awful, awful truth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw herself on her bed, and with her face covered she lay trying to
      sob, trying to shed tears, but the founts of her agony were dry.

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>R. DEARING'S house
      was an old-fashioned structure built long before the Civil War. It fronted
      on the main residential street of the town, and was of red brick partly
      covered with clinging ivy. It had a colonial veranda with the usual tall,
      fluted columns, which were painted white and rested on square blocks of
      masonry. It had been the property of several generations of Dearings more
      or less distinguished in the history of the State, and since the death of
      the doctor's father, a prosperous merchant, slave-holder, and planter, it
      had been in the possession of the brother and sister, who, with an aged
      maternal uncle, General Sylvester, now occupied it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Dearing entered the lower gate of the grounds he saw Kenneth Galt, his
      next-door neighbor, crossing the lawn to reach his own house just beyond a
      low hedge of well-trimmed boxwood. And hearing the clicking of the iron
      gate-latch, Galt paused, turned, and advanced toward his friend. He was a
      handsome man, tall, dark, well-built, about thirty-five years of age, and
      with a strong, secretive face&mdash;the face of a man full of nervous
      force and the never-satisfied hunger of ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've been to church like a good little boy,&rdquo; he laughed, as he paused
      and stood cutting at the grass with his cane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and it is exactly where you ought to have been,&rdquo; Dearing retorted,
      with a smile. &ldquo;If you would only listen to a few good sermons on the right
      line you'd burn up that free-thought library of yours, and quit thinking
      you know more than your good old Godfearing ancestors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I simply couldn't sit and listen to such stuff with a straight face,&rdquo;
       Galt answered. &ldquo;Goodness knows, I've tried it often enough. It really
      seems an insult to a fellow's intelligence. I can't agree with you that
      any man ought to try to think as his forefathers did. You don't in your
      profession, why should a man do it in more vital matters? You don't bleed
      your patients as doctors did fifty years ago, because you know better. I
      believe in evolution of mind as well as of matter. We are constantly
      advancing. Your old-time preacher, with all his good intentions, is a
      stumbling-block to intelligence. You may listen to a man who tells you
      your house is burning down over your head and urges you to save your life,
      but if you don't believe him you wouldn't care to have him pull you out by
      the heels on a cold night to convince you. But you don't hear what I am
      saying!&rdquo; Galt finished, with a short laugh. &ldquo;I am sowing my seed on stony
      ground. I've been in to see the General. I have some important letters
      about the railroad that he and I are going to get built one of these days.
      As a rule, he is more than eager to talk about it, but he was certainly
      out of sorts just now. I have never seen him so upset before. While I was
      talking to him he kept walking up and down the room, and not hearing half
      I was saying. He is not well, is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he really is not in the best of shape,&rdquo; Dearing answered, with a
      thoughtful shadow on his face; &ldquo;but I think he will pull through all
      right. I see him on the porch now. I'll walk on, and talk to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Dearing drew near the house General Sylvester, who was a tall, slightly
      bent old man with long gray beard and hair, came down the steps and walked
      across the grass to a rustic seat under a tree. He was about to sit down,
      but seeing his nephew approaching he remained standing, a gaunt hand held
      over his spectacled eyes to ward off the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been waiting for you,&rdquo; he said, in a piping, irritable voice.
      &ldquo;Kenneth was in to talk business, but it seems to me that I'll never be
      interested in such things any more. What's the use? I didn't want the
      money for myself, anyway. I saw the others coming back from church some
      time ago, and couldn't imagine what delayed you. I've had another row with
      Madge, and this time it is serious&mdash;very, very serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>that's</i> the trouble!&rdquo; Dearing cried, and he attempted to laugh.
      &ldquo;Uncle Tom, in your old age you are just like a school-boy with his first
      sweetheart. You are actually flirting with your own niece. You and she
      bill and coo like doves, and then get cold as ice or as mad as Tucker.
      What's wrong now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think a young girl like she is ought to take the sound advice of
      a man as old and experienced as I am, and she won't do it. That's all&mdash;she
      won't do it, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she <i>ought</i> to,&rdquo; Dearing said, still inclined to jest,
      &ldquo;but you are wise enough to know that no woman ever took the advice of a
      man, young or old. See here, uncle, I'll bet you haven't had your medicine
      yet, and the dinner-bell will ring soon and you will have to wait fifteen
      minutes before you shall taste a bite. You and I 'll quarrel if you don't
      do as I tell you. Madge won't obey you, but you've got to get down on your
      marrow-bones and follow my orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'll take the blasted stuff in time!&rdquo; the General fumed. &ldquo;I don't
      want to eat now, anyway. I tell you, I'm too mad to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it is Fred Walton again,&rdquo; Dearing said, resignedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who else could it be?&rdquo; the old man burst out. &ldquo;She tries to close my eyes
      as to her doings with him; but I got it straight that he was out driving
      with her last night while you were in the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The face of the doctor clouded over. &ldquo;You don't mean to say that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that he was afraid to drive up to the door like a gentleman, but
      met her down-town and took her from there, and when they got back, long
      after dark, he left her at Lizzie Sloan's, to keep us from getting on to
      it. You know, folks will talk about a thing like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dearing's eyes flashed, and a touch of whiteness crept into his face, but
      he said, pacifically: &ldquo;Oh, there must be some mistake. I hardly think
      Madge would&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there <i>isn't</i> any mistake, for she admitted it to me not ten
      minutes ago, and just as good as told me it was none of my business
      besides. Now, listen to me, my boy. I am an old man, but I am still in the
      possession of my faculties, and I know what I am talking about. I was in
      the bank yesterday, and had a talk with his father. He told me frankly
      that he intended to cut the scamp off without a penny. He gave the fellow
      a position of trust in the bank, but instead of behaving himself properly,
      he started into gambling, speculating in futures, and every reckless thing
      he could think of. He turned customers away, scared off depositors, who
      don't like to leave their money in such hands, and in many ways injured
      the business. Old Walton was so mad he could hardly talk to me, and when I
      told him right out how I felt about my niece going with him, he said he
      didn't blame me; that he wouldn't let such a rascal go with a servant of
      his, much less the acknowledged belle of the town, and a prospective
      heiress. Now, Wynn, this is what I have decided to do. You know that I
      have made my will, leaving all I have in the world to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is blamed bully of you, Uncle Tom,&rdquo; Dearing said, laying his hand
      on the old man's shoulder, which he could feel quivering with a passion
      not good for even a younger man. &ldquo;I am sure, neither of us is worthy of
      the great interest you have always taken in us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> are, my boy. I am proud of <i>you</i>. You are already a
      shining light in your profession, and will make all the money you'll ever
      need. But I always have worried about Madge. I want to provide well for
      her, and I haven't many years to live. Sometimes I think I may snuff out
      like a candle without a moment's notice, so I don't intend to leave my
      affairs in such a shape that Fred Walton will gloat over my demise and
      throw away my savings. No, sir. I tell you if your sister does not agree
      to give that scamp up inside of the next twenty-four hours, I will set my
      effects aside for another purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see her and talk to her, Uncle Tom,&rdquo; Dearing promised, gravely. He
      had never seen the General so highly wrought up, nor heard such an
      exasperated ring in his voice. &ldquo;Now, you go take your medicine. Madge will
      be sensible. She loves you, I know she does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, remember what I've said,&rdquo; the old soldier threw back as he turned
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dearing waited till he had disappeared through the side entrance of the
      house, and then he went up the front steps, crossed the wide veranda, with
      its smooth, rain-beaten floor of ancient heart pine, and stood in the
      great hall, straw hat in hand, looking about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see her at once,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;She must come to her senses. She is
      driving uncle to his grave with worry over her silly conduct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Madge!&rdquo; he called out. His voice rang and echoed in the great opening
      through which the walnut stairs and polished balustrade ascended to the
      corridor and sleeping-rooms above, but there was no response.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still holding his hat, with which he fanned his heated face in an
      absent-minded, perturbed sort of way, Dearing went through all the lower
      rooms&mdash;the parlor and library and adjoining study, and even the
      dining-room and kitchen. The colored cook, old Aunt Diana, a former slave
      of the family, in white apron and turbaned head, informed him that his
      sister was in her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know she is, Marse Wynn, 'case she sent Lindy down fer some fresh col'
      water not mo'n ten minutes ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Back to the front hall Dearing went, and thence up the stairs to his
      sister's room, adjoining his own. The door was ajar, but he stood on the
      threshold and rapped softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; It was a sweet young voice, and belonged to a pretty girl
      seventeen or eighteen years of age, who, as Dearing entered the room, sat
      at a quaint mahogany writing-desk between two lace-curtained windows
      through which a gentle breeze was blowing. She wore a becoming wrapper,
      and her small feet were shod in dainty embroidered slippers. Her abundant
      hair was quite dark, and her eyes very blue. She had been writing, for on
      the page of tinted note-paper before her he saw an unfinished sentence in
      the round, schoolgirl hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to disturb you, Madge,&rdquo; Dearing began, &ldquo;but you will have to
      stop anyway soon, and get ready for dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not going down,&rdquo; she told him, her glance falling to the rug at her
      feet. &ldquo;I had breakfast late, and I am not a bit hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that wouldn't be treating Uncle Tom quite right, you know,&rdquo; Dearing
      gently protested, as he took a seat on the broad window-sill, swung his
      hat between his knees, and eyed her significantly. &ldquo;You know how childish
      he is getting, Madge. It really upsets him not to have you at the table.
      He is old-fashioned, and was something of a beau when he was a young man.
      Making a fine lady of you and paying court to you seems to be about all
      the pleasure he gets in life. I know it must be tiresome, but there are
      many things we&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is <i>childish!</i>&rdquo; Margaret exclaimed, her eyes flashing angrily,
      &ldquo;but I bore with it because I loved him, and because mother would have
      approved it; but he is getting worse and worse. He wants me at his beck
      and call every minute in the day, and even if I go out to see one of my
      girl friends he either comes or sends one of the servants to see if
      anything has happened. Then he&mdash;he&mdash;oh, there are a lot of
      things a girl can't put up with!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean his opposition to the visits of a certain friend of yours?&rdquo;
       Dearing said, in a forced tone of indifference, as he glanced out at the
      window. Although his eyes were still ostentatiously averted, he saw her
      cautiously draw a blank sheet of paper over the lines she had written.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that is <i>one</i> thing. Fred Walton is a friend of
      mine, and for all I know his feelings may be hurt by what uncle has said
      and done. I know Fred is wild and reckless, but he has a good side to him&mdash;a
      side everybody can't see who doesn't know him intimately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young as he was, Wynn Dearing was wise in the ways of the world, and he
      well knew that a temperament and will like his sister's would never be
      coerced. He decided to profit by the error in the method of his blustering
      uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have never heard <i>me</i> abuse Fred,&rdquo; he said, gently. &ldquo;Many young
      men who have wealthy parents are inclined to 'sow wild oats,' as the old
      folks say; but really, Madge&rdquo;&mdash;and he was smiling now&mdash;&ldquo;for an
      honest, inoffensive cereal, the 'wild oat' has to bear the burden of many
      a tough young weed. Charity is said to cover a multitude of sins, but for
      genuine selfsacrifice give me the old-fashioned, long-bearded wild oat, in
      all its verdant and succulent&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother, I'm not in a mood for silliness!&rdquo; the girl interrupted him,
      quickly, and with an impatient flush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not either, Madge.&rdquo; He took one of his knees between his hands, and
      drew it up toward him. &ldquo;The fact is, I am worried&mdash;worried like
      everything! I may not show it, but this thing has taken a deep hold on me.
      Something has got to be done, and that right away. Young folks may love
      each other, or <i>think</i> they love each other, and if it does no harm
      to any one <i>else</i>, why, all well and good. But if their love business
      is causing suffering&mdash;yes, and positive bodily injury to another&mdash;then
      they ought to stop and ponder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that Uncle Tom&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean this, Madge, and now I am talking to you as a physician&mdash;<i>his</i>
      physician, too. The old man is actually so near the end of his natural
      life that irritation like this is apt to undermine what little
      constitution he has left. I've known old men to worry themselves into
      softening of the brain over smaller things than this. You may not think it
      would make much difference; but remember that if any act of yours and Fred
      Walton's were to cause his death, even indirectly, you could never outlive
      the reproach of your conscience. Uncle Tom is in a dangerous condition:
      his heart-action is bad, and so are his kidneys. You are too young a girl
      to take such a responsibility as that on your shoulders; besides, Madge, I
      must say that Fred&mdash;it is my duty as a brother to say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to abuse him; remember, you have not done it so far!&rdquo;
       Margaret broke in. &ldquo;You won't gain by it, brother. The whole town has
      talked of nothing lately but him and his faults, and I appreciated your
      silence, and so does he. We were speaking about it only yesterday, and he
      praised you for it. He said you were the truest, most perfect gentleman he
      had ever known, that you knew human nature too well to expect young men to
      be absolutely perfect, and that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn't going to say a word against his <i>honor</i>, Madge,&rdquo; Dearing
      interrupted her, gently; &ldquo;but I am going to say this: if I were in <i>his</i>
      place right now I'd feel that I could not conscientiously, or even quite
      honorably, continue to pay attention to a young lady situated&mdash;well,
      situated <i>just as you are</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what do you mean?&rdquo; the girl asked, her lip quivering stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, sister, and nothing else. We may say what we please about Fred's
      good qualities, his sincerity, his&mdash;his devotion to you; his plans,
      whatever they are; but a very disagreeable fact stands out like a black
      splotch on the whole business, and that is simply this: Fred really has
      failed to make good in the way a man ought to make good who aspires to the
      hand of a girl like yourself. His father gave him a splendid chance in the
      bank, but Fred's best friends admit that he hasn't profited by it. Instead
      of attending to business and helping his old daddy&mdash;who, harsh old
      skinflint though he is as to money matters, is a safe man in any community&mdash;instead
      of doing what was expected of him, Fred&mdash;well, he has turned his
      father against him, that's all. The old man swears he is going to cut him
      off without a penny, and everybody in town knows he means it; Fred doesn't
      dispute it himself. So, taking that along with <i>the other thing</i>, I
      honestly can't see how he can talk of love and marriage to a girl like you
      are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>other</i> thing do you mean?&rdquo; Margaret demanded, pale with
      suppressed emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean the fact that his marriage to you would cause Uncle Tom to
      disinherit you outright. A man might sink low enough to want to marry a
      girl after he himself has been disinherited for his irregular conduct, but
      no creature with a spark of manhood in him would let his act impoverish
      the woman he loves. I have said nothing against him so far, but when he
      knows what uncle has determined to do&mdash;when he is told that if he
      persists&mdash;well&rdquo;&mdash;Dealing's eyes were burning now with the fire
      of genuine anger&mdash;&ldquo;he'll have <i>me</i> to reckon with, that's all&mdash;<i>me</i>,
      Madge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret stared at him for a moment, and then, with a piteous little sob,
      she covered her face with her hands. &ldquo;You are going to <i>tell</i> him!&rdquo;
       she said, huskily. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Dearing stood up and laid his hand on her head.
      &ldquo;I'm going to tell him, Madge, but it will be only for his own good. In
      any case, he couldn't honorably ask you to marry him <i>now</i>, and the
      delay&mdash;if he is willing to wait&mdash;won't do either of you any
      harm. You are both young, and the world is before you. You can't realize
      it now, Madge, but this very thing may be the making of him. If he loves
      you as truly as he ought, this will be only a spur toward proving his
      worthiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother, must you really&mdash;? oh, I can't&mdash;can't&mdash;&rdquo; The girl
      stood up, her cheeks wet with tears, and clasped her hands round his neck
      appealingly. &ldquo;You really must not! He is already in trouble. Surely&mdash;surely&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no other way, Madge, but I'll not be rough; I pity the poor chap
      too much for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you intend to&mdash;to see him?&rdquo; She was sobbing again, her face
      pressed against his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This evening, Madge, if I can find him at home. There is no other way.
      Uncle and I are the only protectors you have, and he is too angry and
      easily wrought up to be trusted with the matter. I'd better manage it; but
      you know I'll be fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl gazed fixedly at him for a moment, and then, in a storm of tears,
      she threw herself oh her bed and hid her face in a pillow. Glancing at her
      pityingly, and with moisture in his own eyes, Dearing turned from the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for them both,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;They are having hard luck, and
      yet Fred Walton isn't, from any point of view, worthy of her; there are no
      two ways about it. He has got himself into a terrible plight, and he has
      no right to involve my sister. No, and he sha'n't!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE greater part of
      the ensuing afternoon was spent by Dr. Dearing in his musty little office
      on the ground-floor of a building in the central square of the town which
      was devoted to lawyers' quarters, the rooms of the sheriff of the county,
      and the council-chamber where the mayor held his court. He received a few
      patients, made some examinations, wrote several prescriptions, and,
      considering that it was Sunday, he felt that he was fairly well occupied.
      His mind, however, was constantly on the topic of the morning and the
      disagreeable task confronting him. Finally he turned over the placard on
      the door till the word &ldquo;out&rdquo; was exposed to view, and went home to supper.
      Here, however, he met only General Sylvester, who, a dejected picture of
      offended loneliness, sat on the veranda, a dry cigar between his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Madge?&rdquo; Dearing asked, half standing, half sitting on the
      balustrade in front of the old gentleman, and assuming a casual tone which
      was far from natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She hasn't been down at all to-day,&rdquo; the General answered, pettishly. &ldquo;I
      wouldn't send for her. She knew I wouldn't knuckle like that, but she
      knows I always expect to walk with her Sunday afternoons, and she stayed
      pouting in her room. She resents what has been said about that blackleg
      gambler, and wants to show it as plainly as possible, so there won't be
      any mistake between her view and mine. She knows I don't intend to leave
      any property to her if she keeps this up, but she doesn't care a rap.
      She's dead in love with the scamp, and, bad as he is, she glories in the
      opportunity to show her contempt for me and all that pertains to me. She
      can't toss <i>me</i> about like a ball, my boy! This thing has got to end
      right here and now, or I'll see my lawyer to-morrow and put something on
      paper that may never be wiped out while I am alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, give her till to-morrow, then,&rdquo; Dearing said, with strange,
      suppressed calmness. &ldquo;Her very sullenness now may be a sign that she is
      about to give him up. I've talked to her, and, while I am not certain what
      she'll do, I have an idea that she may respect your wishes and abide by
      your judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think so,&rdquo; the old man said, with an anxious look into the face
      of his nephew; &ldquo;that is, not so long as the rascal holds her to whatever
      understanding they may have between them. When I was a young man&rdquo;&mdash;Sylvester
      clinched his fist and pounded his knee, as if to emphasize his words&mdash;&ldquo;things
      like this did not hang fire. A man who could make no showing as to his
      being a proper suitor for a girl under age was given orders from her
      family to desist in his harmful attentions, and if he refused he was
      promptly dealt with&mdash;that's all: <i>dealt</i> with!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nowadays it's different, Uncle Tom,&rdquo; Dearing said, with the tone of an
      older man. &ldquo;Shooting or threatening to shoot about a young woman is sure
      to cast a blight on her reputation, and there generally is some other
      method to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You learned that up among those Yankees!&rdquo; the General said, alluding to
      the period his nephew had spent in a New York medical college. &ldquo;But I am
      miserable enough as it is without wanting you to stain your hands with
      blood and have us all brought into court to justify your course. He is a
      coward, I'm sure; no man has any pride or backbone who will cling on to a
      respectable family, under the pretext of being in love, when his own
      people have cut him off. His mother belonged to a good family, but he
      hasn't inherited any refinement of feeling from that side of the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think, to do Fred <i>full</i> justice,&rdquo; Dearing gently urged,
      &ldquo;that he quite realizes the seriousness of your objections to him. I
      really believe, when he is told of the step you are about to take, that he
      will act sensibly. He has a good side to him when he is thoroughly
      himself, and I am going to look him up after supper and lay the whole
      thing fairly before him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Margaret know you&mdash;&rdquo; The General's voice failed to carry
      further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I've told her what I intend to do, and I think that is one reason
      she has remained in her room. She is hard hit, Uncle Tom. Girls never can
      understand things of this sort. Their sympathies always go with the
      unfortunate, and Madge knows Fred is down, and that most people are
      against him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope you will accomplish something,&rdquo; General Sylvester said,
      hopefully. &ldquo;You can straighten it out if any one can. I can trust you,
      Wynn, and I am proud of you&mdash;proud of you in every way. I never
      regret the loss of the old order of things when I think of what you are
      and what you are bound to become as a leader of young men of your period.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are certainly sharp enough to pull the wool over kind old eyes like
      yours, Uncle Tom.&rdquo; Dearing laughed as he leaned forward and laid his hand
      on the old man's shoulder. &ldquo;In your day young blades boasted of what they
      did under cover of the night, but we thank the darkness for its shelter
      and don't talk of our acts. Why, you old-timers didn't know the first
      principles of devilment! If it were not giving away professional secrets,
      I'd tell you things that would make your hair stand on end. You've heard
      me say I believe in the good old-time, psalm-singing, God-fearing religion&mdash;well,
      I do. The longer I live the more I think we need it. Look what modern
      thought has done for Kenneth Galt. He has read so much on science and
      philosophy that he has reduced us all&mdash;good, bad, and indifferent&mdash;to
      mere cosmic dust. According to him, we are simply mud babies energized by
      planetary force, and living on the pap of graft. Ask him to account for
      good spiritual impulses, and he will&mdash;if he admits there are any&mdash;show
      you conclusively that good conduct is the mere evolutionary result of
      communal self-interest; men came to believe murder was wrong only because
      they didn't want their <i>own</i> throats cut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always wondered what Kenneth <i>does</i> believe,&rdquo; Sylvester said,
      with his first smile. &ldquo;He certainly is an interesting man; and he's rich,
      and growing more so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he was well provided for at the start,&rdquo; responded Dearing, &ldquo;and he
      has invested wisely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen him talking to Margaret several times of late,&rdquo; Sylvester
      remarked. &ldquo;That is one thing that irritates me. I don't care a red cent
      about his cranky religious views; they will take care of themselves, for
      he is a straight, safe, and honorable man; and if this harum-scarum Fred
      Walton had not been taking up so much of her time, why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You old match-maker!&rdquo; Dearing laughed. &ldquo;I'm going to stir up Aunt Diana
      and get something to eat. I am as hungry as a bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he and his uncle sat together at the long table in the big
      dining-room, Dearing asked the cook if she had notified his sister that
      supper was served.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesser, Marse Wynn,&rdquo; the woman answered over the coffee-tray she was
      putting down, &ldquo;I sent Lindy up dar to her room, and she say young miss
      didn't want er bite. I reckon she sho' is sick. She haint tetch er
      mouthful since 'er breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let her alone,&rdquo; Dearing said, as his eyes met the wavering glance
      of his uncle across the table. &ldquo;She will be all right in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gloomy meal over, the General strode back to the veranda, and Wynn
      went up to his room. He did not light the gas, as he intended doing, for
      it occurred to him that there was really no need for it, and he sat down
      in the darkness. He could see one of the windows of Margaret's room in the
      ell of the building, across the open court. A dim light was burning there,
      and the curtains were drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;that fellow has hit her hard. Women have a
      wonderful amount of sympathy for him. It may be that Mrs. Barry is correct
      in her fears, and that Dora may be in love with him, too. Beautiful,
      trusting Dora&mdash;even <i>she</i> is suffering on his account. Yes, I
      must see him. There is no other way.&rdquo; Dearing stood up and went to his
      bureau to get a fresh handkerchief, and while his hand was fumbling
      collars, cuffs, and neckties, it touched the cool, smooth handle of a
      revolver. He picked it up and held it for a moment reflectively, and then
      laid it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'll not go to see him even with the thought that I may have to use
      force,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My mission in life is to <i>cure</i> men, not to spill
      their blood. They say he sometimes goes armed, and if we met on that sort
      of level there might be trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He closed the drawer, stood for a moment looking at the light in the
      window of Margaret's room, and then, shrugging his broad shoulders, he
      turned away. He met no one on the stairs, but as he passed out at the
      front door he saw the flare of his uncle's cigar and the wrinkled,
      brooding face and gray head and beard at the end of the veranda. Going
      down the wide brick walk, which was edged by rows of well-trimmed boxwood,
      he descried, near the gate, a willowy figure in white. It was Margaret.
      She looked up as he approached, and in the piteous lines of her face he
      read her final desperate appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were in your room,&rdquo; he said, in an effort at gentle
      deception. &ldquo;Madge, old girl, I'll have to take you in hand.&rdquo; He passed his
      fingers playfully under her cold chin. &ldquo;You are on a direct road to a
      thirty-day course of that very tonic you despised so much last spring. No
      dinner to-day and no supper to-night. I don't get any fee for doctoring
      you, but I'm going to keep you in good shape as an advertisement, if for
      nothing else. I don't intend to have my patients throwing it in my face
      that they won't believe in me until I cure my own family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not return his smile, and drew back from his caress as if she half
      resented it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you really going to see Fred?&rdquo; she asked, falteringly, her eyes fixed
      coldly, half fearfully, on his through the dim, vague starlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Madge,&rdquo; he answered, simply. &ldquo;I've thought it over deliberately and
      calmly, with no feeling of ill-will toward him, and I can't see my duty in
      any other way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night?&rdquo; She breathed hard, her hand on her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right away, sister; that is, if he is in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved a little nearer to him. He saw the hand which started toward his
      arm tremble, as it diverted its course to one of the palings of the fence,
      which it clutched in visible desperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you realize,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;that to&mdash;to tell him what Uncle Tom
      intends to do in case he and I don't give each other up may insult him? He
      is not a man to care about a girl's fortune; he hasn't shown that he wants
      his father's money. He knows that I don't let such things weigh with me.
      What you are now starting out to do may be the immediate cause of&mdash;of
      our both <i>defying you!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; Dearing said. &ldquo;Well, in that case I shall have done all in my
      power to protect your interests. I'll tell you one thing, though, Madge,
      little girl: the matter looks black enough as it stands; but, really, if I
      felt that you were going absolutely penniless to a man who has shown
      himself as reckless of his own interests as Fred Walton has, I'd be blue
      in earnest, and&mdash;and I don't know that I'd be quite able to restrain
      my temper if such a reckless spendthrift were to thrust himself between
      you and your natural rights, boldly robbing you, blind as you now are, of
      what you ought to have, and which later in life you will sadly need. I am
      not a fighting man, but&mdash;well, he'd better not interfere with your
      material interests, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrank back before the force and suppressed fury in his face and
      voice, and now, her last hope gone, she simply stared, speechless. He had
      put his hand upon the iron latch of the gate when she caught his arm and
      clung to it convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, brother, you don't know Fred as I do!&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;He has some
      faults, I'll admit; but he is true and noble at heart. You see, I've heard
      him talk in a confidential way and you haven't. The last time I met him he
      almost cried in telling me of his troubles. He does try very hard to
      please his father. You see, I am convinced that he has just reached a sort
      of turning-point, and I am afraid this very thing may make him more
      desperate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he is sincere,&rdquo; Wynn retorted, &ldquo;and is any sort of man, he will be
      glad of being warned against impoverishing the girl he professes to love.
      You leave it all to me, sister. I am not going to be harsh with him. I
      don't really dislike him, and he has nothing against me.&rdquo; From the
      expression of utter despair in her eyes he knew that she intended to
      resist no longer. She lowered her head to the top of the fence, and
      without looking at him, she asked, in a smothered voice: &ldquo;What time do you
      think you will&mdash;will be back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't tell, Madge. I may not find him at once, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall wait up for you,&rdquo; she gulped. &ldquo;I couldn't close my eyes until I
      see you and know what he says. Oh, brother, I am afraid&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid of what?&rdquo; he demanded, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly know how to express it.&rdquo; She looked up, and on her cheeks lay
      the damp traces of the tears she had wiped away on her sleeve. &ldquo;But he is
      desperate. I am actually afraid he may try to&mdash;to do himself harm. It
      looked, the other evening, as if he were constantly on the point of
      telling me something about some crisis or other in his affairs which has
      just come up. He would start out as if about to make a disclosure of some
      horrible kind, and then he would stop and say: 'But I can't worry you by
      telling you everything. It won't help matters to talk about my trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor chap,&rdquo; Dearing said. &ldquo;I will not be hard on him, sister; I promise
      you that. I may find him at church; he sometimes goes to take Dora Barry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; they are good friends,&rdquo; Margaret said. &ldquo;That is one thing I admire
      in him. She is poor, and doesn't receive much attention. Fred takes her to
      places and goes to see her out of pure kindness of heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm off,&rdquo; Dearing said, as he turned to leave. &ldquo;Now you go to bed,
      young lady, and forget about this disagreeable mess for to-night, anyway.
      It may be all for the best.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>EAVING Madge mute
      and motionless at the gate, staring through the starlight after him,
      Dearing strode down the street past the fine old home of Kenneth Galt,
      which was set well back in spacious grounds on the left. Along the way
      were old-fashioned houses in bad condition, old buildings which had been
      modernized, and which stood on well-kept lawns, and others which had no
      touch of antiquity. After a few minutes he reached a plain two-story frame
      house which had once been white, but now showed little trace of its
      original paint. It was the home of Fred Walton's father, Stafford's
      well-to-do banker, money-lender, &ldquo;note-shaver,&rdquo; and all-round speculator
      in stocks, bonds, and real estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fred may be here,&rdquo; Dearing reflected, as he paused at the ramshackle gate
      and viewed the forbidding old house as it loomed up among the trees, fifty
      yards from where he stood; &ldquo;but he'd certainly be excusable for seeking a
      more cheerful place to spend an evening, considering that meddlesome
      stepmother of his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The parsimony of old Simon Walton could not have been better illustrated
      than by the fact that not a ray of light showed itself in all the rooms of
      the house. It was said of him that, fond of smoking though he was, he
      never lighted his pipe without getting a match and tobacco from some one
      else. At all events, he was at home. And as he went up the uneven brick
      walk, Wynn saw him seated on the front porch without his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was tall, lank, and raw-boned, and though nearly seventy years of age,
      his brown hair and short, scraggy whiskers were devoid of the slightest
      touch of gray. He was a man who, though outwardly sound of body, brain,
      and limb, was not without certain haunting fears of dissolution. He had
      had a slight stroke of paralysis which had left a numbness in his right
      side, and he was constantly trying to obey certain directions Dearing had
      laid down on the day his clerks had found him unable to rise from his desk
      in his bank. Dearing's skill had put him on his feet again, and the young
      doctor had tried diplomatically to show his patient that the cause of the
      trouble lay in an overworked brain too sharply centred on a none too
      worthy purpose. But in this he had failed. Old Simon would have believed
      in any lotion, any surgical operation, or any medicine prescribed by
      Dearing, no matter how costly, for that was in the young man's line; but
      he declined to listen to any hint&mdash;from such a source, at least&mdash;that
      his mental watchfulness ought to be curbed. He had won by his method, and
      that was ample proof of its correctness. He had risen from between the
      plough-handles, he told Wynn with a satirical laugh, and men who had
      advised him to think less of the almighty dollar and more of his God were
      in their mountain hovels giving away advice for others to live by. The
      wise fellows who had said in his youth that he was &ldquo;as close as the bark
      on a tree&rdquo; and &ldquo;too mean to live&rdquo; were now ready to beg at his feet for
      money to enable them to purchase food for their families.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here you are at last!&rdquo; he thundered, as Wynn approached through the
      gloom. &ldquo;And it's high time, I am here to say! It doesn't take a man two
      hours to go to that bank and bring back a simple statement like that. I
      want to know to a fraction of a cent, too, just how that thing stands, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you don't owe <i>me</i> a penny, Mr. Walton.&rdquo; Dearing laughed. &ldquo;I
      only wish you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I thought it was Fred!&rdquo; old Simon ejaculated, not a little chagrined
      by his lack of hospitality. &ldquo;Me and him have had a little quarrel over his
      way of doing things, and I was looking for him to bring some papers from
      the bank. He went off with the key an hour ago, and hasn't showed up yet.
      Have you seen anything of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; in fact, that's what I dropped in for. I wanted to speak to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I reckon he's not at your house calling on Miss Margaret. I thought
      he might be there, or gone to take that other girl, the daughter of that
      old picture-painter, to meeting. I picked up a note from her to him the
      other day, making some appointment or other. I might know he wasn't at <i>your</i>
      house, though, after the talk I had with the General. Huh! your uncle
      needn't be mealy-mouthed with me about what he thinks of the scamp! In my
      day and time a fellow of that stripe would be egged out of the community
      he lived in. But the blamed fools here in Stafford say Fred's pardonable
      to some extent because I've saved up a few cents. Huh! I'll show them and
      I'll show him a thing or two before I am through! I've given him a good
      education at a fine, high-priced college, and put him in the bank in a
      place of trust, and he is treating it as if it was a front seat at a
      circus. Huh! they all laugh and call him the 'Stafford Prince'; they say
      he is a high-roller; that he's invented a cocktail, and lets bank-notes go
      like leaves in a high wind. They needn't say it is due to the little I've
      made, either, for there's yourself, for instance. You had money and
      property left you, but it didn't make a stark, staring idiot out of you.
      By gum! I never see you or hear of your fine operations without wanting to
      cuff that fellow behind the ear and kick him out into the street. Came to
      breakfast this morning with his eyes all bunged up and swollen. There is
      one thing about him that is to his credit, I'll admit, and that is he
      won't lie when you are looking him smack dab in the face, and when I asked
      him if he had been playing poker he acknowledged it. Think of that! A boy
      of <i>mine</i>&mdash;of Simon Walton's&mdash;playing cards for whopping
      big stakes when I have toiled and stinted and saved as I have to gain the
      little headway I've got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I see he is not here,&rdquo; Dearing said, awkwardly. &ldquo;Perhaps I can find
      him up-town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't hurry; set down,&rdquo; and the gaunt man stood up and pointed to another
      chair. &ldquo;I clean forgot to be polite, I'm so worked up. Take a chair&mdash;take
      a chair. I simply want to see what it feels like to sit and talk to a
      decent man under thirty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I thank you, Mr. Walton, I really can't stay,&rdquo; and Dearing laid his
      hand gently on the quivering shoulder of the old man. &ldquo;But I want you to
      remember my warning about that little trouble of yours. You must not let
      things stir you up like this. You can't stand it, you know, as well as
      some other men can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show me how to help it&mdash;show me how to <i>want</i> to help it!&rdquo;
       spluttered the banker. &ldquo;I don't want to keep my temper! I don't want to
      hold my tongue! I wish the law of the land would let me take him, big as
      he is, and thrash him on the streets before the very folks that call him,
      as some have, an improvement on his stingy old daddy. Once I thought I had
      him. Once I thought I'd caught him dickering with bank funds, and I had
      started to have him put in limbo when he showed me I was wrong. That's the
      kind of man I am! I put honesty above everything else, and I won't hide
      dishonor, even in my own blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm off,&rdquo; Wynn Dearing said. &ldquo;I see I only keep you going on the
      very topic I have warned you against. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the young doctor was approaching the gate he saw a figure in gray,
      enveloped, as to head and shoulders, in an old cashmere shawl, emerge from
      a clump of plum-trees near the fence. It was Fred Walton's stepmother, a
      tall, thin woman of more than sixty years of age, and even dim as the
      starlight was he noticed the hardness of her features as she clutched the
      shawl under her chin and eagerly peered out from its folds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we have had a day of it, Dr. Dearing!&rdquo; she said, familiarly, and with
      a dry, forced laugh. &ldquo;When you came in at the gate just now I made the
      same mistake Simon did&mdash;I thought it was Fred, and hung back at the
      side of the house to hear the row. I reckon the boy has decided he's had
      enough tongue-lashing for one day, and don't intend to sleep here
      to-night. I don't blame his father one bit,&rdquo; she ran on, volubly, &ldquo;and I
      have the first one to meet who really does. Fred certainly keeps himself
      in the public eye. There is hardly a day that some fresh report don't crop
      out as to his scrapes. And the match-makers! Great goodness! They have
      enough to keep ten towns the size of this busy. They are eager to see now
      which Fred will tie to for life: your sister, with all her money and fine
      old name, or that strip of a girl who paints and teaches for a bare
      living. Some say she is daft about him, and that if your uncle kicks him
      out he will settle on her. That's what folks say, you know. The truth is,
      I live sort of out of the way, and don't hear all that is going the
      rounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a matter I am not posted on, Mrs. Walton,&rdquo; Dearing said, as he
      opened the gate and politely raised his hat in parting. &ldquo;I must hurry. I
      only wanted to see Fred a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he neared the central square of the town the rays of light from the
      church where he had that morning attended service streamed across the
      green, and he approached the little edifice, ascended the steps to the
      vestibule, and cautiously peered in at the worshippers, wondering if by
      any chance Fred Walton might be there as Dora Barry's escort. But no one
      of the numerous backs turned toward him resembled Fred's, and his glance
      moved on to the pulpit. The choir was in full view, facing the door, and
      beside the keyboard of the organ sat the girl who played it. Was it the
      shadows from the gas above her, or was the tense expression in her eyes
      and the droop to the sweet young mouth due to some trouble even greater
      than any he had yet surmised? He shuddered as he turned away and pursued
      his walk toward the square. He would look for Walton at the bank, and try
      to divest his mind of the disagreeable duty he had to perform; but Dora's
      face continued to haunt him. The mute appeal of her white, shapely hands
      patiently folded in her lap, the suggestion of utter despair in her whole
      bearing, clung to him and wrung his manly heart. She had been his playmate
      when she was a tiny girl and he an awkward boy in his teens. He had loved
      her gentle old father, with his long hair and high, poetic brow, and had
      believed for years that Dora had inherited his genius. The artist had gone
      back to Paris to study, intending to send for his wife and child when
      fortune smiled, as he was sure it would. But he had died there, and was
      buried by his fellow-students of the Latin Quarter. They had written the
      fact to the wife and orphan, but that was all. It was his child who was in
      trouble, and Dearing's heart ached with a dull, insistent pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a light in the bank; he saw its gleam through the old-fashioned
      panes of glass in front, but it went out just as he drew near the door,
      which he saw was slightly ajar. As he stood wondering, he heard some one
      coming. It was Fred Walton; he was smoking, and the flare of his cigar
      lighted up his dark, handsome face for a bare instant. He was tall,
      well-built, and strong of physique.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! Is that you, Fred?&rdquo; Dealing called out. There was a pause. Walton
      seemed to shrink back into the darkness for a moment; then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Who is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I, Fred&mdash;Wynn Dearing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is you!&rdquo; Walton drew the heavy door to after him as he came out
      and locked it. Then they stood together on the sidewalk in the faint rays
      from a gaslight on the corner near by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've been looking for you, Fred. I went to your house; your father
      told me you might be here. Can't we go in the bank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fred Walton stared. His face was rigid; beads of sweat stood on his brow
      and cheeks; the cigar in his mouth shook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is terribly hot in there,&rdquo; he said, after a pause. &ldquo;I was looking over
      the books, and&mdash;almost fainted. I didn't think it worth while to
      unscrew the rear windows, and not a breath of air is stirring in the
      beastly hole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might walk on to my office; it is always cool. I never bother to shut
      the windows, even before a rain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if&mdash;if you wish it, Wynn; that is, if you wish to&mdash;to see
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I want to talk to you, Fred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked side by side along the pavement. Walton had his hat off, and
      was wiping his face with his handkerchief. Once his foot struck against
      some object, and he almost fell. Something like an oath of impatience
      escaped his lips as he drew himself up and caught the slow, deliberate
      step of his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the door of his office, Dearing unlocked it, pushed it open, and
      they entered the little reception-room in the dark. The doctor struck a
      match and lighted a lamp on a table, and pointed to a rocking-chair. &ldquo;Take
      a seat, Fred.&rdquo; A cold smile which gave his face almost a wry look lay on
      his firm mouth as he himself sat down near a table on which lay some books
      and magazines. He had not removed his eyes from his companion, who, hat
      in hand, was settling heavily into the big chair. &ldquo;I've got an unpleasant
      duty before me, Fred&mdash;darned unpleasant, because we've been friends
      all our lives, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right, Wynn, go ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is about you and my sister, Fred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid it was that, Wynn,&rdquo; the young man muttered. &ldquo;The thought
      came to me when I heard your voice in the dark just now. Well, nothing you
      can say will surprise me. I am prepared for anything&mdash;for the very
      worst; in fact, I am prepared to have Marga&mdash;pardon me, your sister&mdash;send
      me word that she herself wishes to see no more of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no such message as <i>that</i>, Fred, but still it is my duty to
      lay the facts before you just as they are; and I am going to do it, with
      the hope, old man, that you'll be reasonable and&mdash;help me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a calm voice, full of sincerity and stern conviction, Dearing then
      recounted all that had taken place between him and his uncle, ending with:
      &ldquo;I give you my word, Fred, and the opinion of a physician who knows the
      case, that my uncle is not only likely to worry himself into the grave
      over the matter, but that he will absolutely, and at once, cut my sister
      out of her rightful inheritance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she&mdash;surely she herself will tell General Sylvester that she is
      willing to&mdash;forget me, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dearing, without looking directly at the speaker, shook his head. &ldquo;It is
      only fair to her to say that she is not made that way, Fred. She believes
      in you; nothing on earth will change her; she believes you are the soul of
      honor, and is ready to throw my uncle's money into his face. That's why I
      came to you&mdash;to <i>you</i>. I thought, and Uncle Tom did, too, that
      under the circumstances you might, you see, rather than stand between her
      and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dearing went no further. He was interrupted by the look of agony which had
      clutched the lineaments of the listener like the throes of death. Walton's
      hands, outspread till the fingers looked like prongs of hard wood, rose to
      his face and covered it. Dearing saw a shudder of restrained emotion rise
      in the strong frame and quiver through it. A sound like a sob issued from
      the bent form. Neither spoke for more than a minute. The step of a
      passer-by rang sharply on the still night air. The tones from Dora Barry's
      organ swelled out in the distance and rolled toward them, followed by the
      singing of the choir. Suddenly Walton rose, and leaned on the back of his
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all up with me, Wynn!&rdquo; he groaned, deeply. &ldquo;After to-night you'll
      never be troubled by me in any shape, form, or fashion. I wish I could be
      man enough to make a clean breast of it all to you, but what's the use? It
      wouldn't do any good or help the matter. You'll know to-morrow, as all
      Stafford will. I'll say this, though: I am wholly unworthy of your
      sister's confidence and respect. To have paid her such attentions,
      situated as I am situated, was an insult. I have committed an offence
      known so far to no one but myself, and which can never be pardoned. I am
      at the end of my rope, old chap. If I could undo my act by ending my
      wretched life, I'd do it to-night. I love your sister as sincerely as a
      man ever loved a woman, but I have no earthly right to think of her, much
      less to consider myself a suitor for her hand. When she knows the truth&mdash;the
      whole wretched truth&mdash;she herself will turn from me in disgust, and
      blush with shame at the thought of ever having encouraged me. You have the
      right, as a man and her brother, to kick me for my presumption. I can't go
      into details. I could not bear to see your face as you hear it, but it
      will be in every one's mouth tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Fred, surely you&mdash;&rdquo; Dearing started to say, but, raising his
      hand, Walton interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Wynn. I have said enough. I have no right to send your sister
      even a farewell message, certainly not to tell her what my feeling for her
      is at this moment; but it will be best for the General to rest assured, so
      you may give him my word that I'll never cross her path again. I am going
      away to-night, never to be seen here any more. I am not man enough to face
      this town after my conduct becomes public. I was weak. I fell&mdash;that's
      all. I don't know what will become of me. I blame no one but myself,
      certainly not my poor old father. You will not see me again. Goodbye. I
      need not wish you well; you will do well. You were marked by Fate from the
      start as one of the lucky, <i>uncursed</i> ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor stood up and extended his hand to detain him, but Walton had
      turned hastily away. Dearing heard his dragging feet in the corridor and
      then on the sidewalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor chap! It is something very, very serious,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Nothing but
      terrible trouble would work a man up like that. I wonder if&mdash;&rdquo; He
      started and shuddered. Mrs. Barry's pale, troubled face of the morning
      came before him, then Dora's downcast attitude as he had seen her in the
      choir only a few moments before. He started, and his blood ran cold
      through his veins. Could it be possible&mdash;could any man sink low
      enough to&mdash;? No; he would not even think of it, else he would regret
      not having killed the man as he sat bowed before him. No, it wasn't that&mdash;the
      human monster did not live who could pluck and stamp upon that beautiful
      and helpless flower of maidenhood. He extinguished the lamp, went out into
      the dark street, and closed his door. The congregation was leaving the
      church as he reached it. Among the last to go was Dora. He fell in behind
      her, but made no effort to catch her up. She had shown no willingness to
      talk to him that morning, and he would not disturb her now. Perhaps the
      girl was really in love with Walton, and had gleaned some inkling of the
      young man's trouble. Yes, that would explain her present depression. He
      walked behind her till she disappeared at the cottage gate; then he turned
      and went homeward past Kenneth Galt's grounds. He saw a spark of fire
      moving about under the trees to the right of the gloomy-looking residence
      which to-night seemed devoid of any light, and knew that Galt was there
      smoking alone, as was his habit at that hour. Dearing put his hand out to
      the gate-latch. Perhaps a chat with his philosophic friend would help
      clear his brain of the maddening thoughts which surged about him, but he
      paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; Madge will be up waiting for me,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;I may as well meet
      her and let her know the worst. Poor girl, she'll have to be brave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved on to his own gate. There was no one on the veranda, as was often
      the case in warm weather, but in a little pagoda-shaped summer-house on
      the lawn he descried a white object. It stirred as the hinges of the gate
      creaked, and he entered, It was Margaret, and she came to him like a
      spirit across the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you I'd wait,&rdquo; she reminded him, and her voice sounded strange and
      even harsh in its guttural tendency. &ldquo;I thought you'd never come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through all that had passed between him and Fred Walton that night
      Dealing's anger and resentment had been held in check by sympathy for the
      man in his desperate plight and despair; but now, as he saw the evidences
      of his sister's agony written all too plainly upon her young being, his
      indignation kindled. The scoundrel, the coward, was running away to keep
      from facing public opinion, yet was leaving this poor, crushed girl to
      suffer in consequence of his conduct!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought not to have waited,&rdquo; he reproached her, in a tone she had never
      heard him use. &ldquo;Your being here now, looking like this, is an
      acknowledgment that you actually <i>care</i> for the cowardly cur&mdash;you,
      who ought to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother, stop!&rdquo; The girl clutched his arms. She breathed hard against his
      breast as she leaned close to him. &ldquo;'The cowardly cur,' you say&mdash;<i>you</i>,
      who have never abused him before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder now that I let him go with a whole bone in his body,&rdquo; Dearing
      retorted, raspingly. &ldquo;I didn't realize what I was doing, or I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what <i>do</i> you mean?&rdquo; Margaret interrupted, giving him a quick,
      impatient shake. &ldquo;You needn't come here trying to make me believe vile
      slander. It is easy enough for lies to get circulated in a town noted for
      its tattling busybodies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've had his own deliberate confession,&rdquo; Dearing answered. &ldquo;With his head
      hanging in shame and his face covered he told me he was forced by some
      dishonorable act to leave town, never to return. He didn't tell me what he
      had done; he said he'd rather not go into it, but that it would all be out
      to-morrow. Of his own accord he proposed to give you up, and said I might
      tell Uncle Tom that he'd never see or write to you again. Whatever it is,
      you ought to have sufficient pride to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dealing stopped short. With a low moan Margaret was reeling toward him,
      and, as he caught her to keep her from falling, he saw that she had
      fainted. Lifting her up, Dearing bore her into the house and up the stairs
      to her room. He laid her on her bed, glad that his uncle and the servants
      had not noticed the accident. He sprinkled her face with water. She opened
      her eyes as he bent over her in the darkness, and recognized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are all right now, Madge, darling,&rdquo; he said, huskily, as he fondly
      kissed her. &ldquo;Be calm and go to sleep. You must not suffer on account of
      this man. He is absolutely unworthy of your regard, and that ought to
      settle it, so far as you are concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret sat up, and put her arms about her brother's neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid the other day that something was wrong&mdash;that something
      terrible was about to happen to him,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;He was awfully gloomy.
      He seemed to be on the point of confiding in me every minute, but couldn't
      get it out. You say you have no idea what it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but he says it will be public property to-morrow. Try to forget it.
      You must call your pride to your aid. Uncle was right in his objections to
      him, and you were wrong. I neglected my duty in not seeing him even sooner
      than I did. Now, good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving her with a kiss on her cold cheek, Dearing, choking down a lump in
      his throat, went to his own room. The windows facing the south looked out
      on Kenneth Galt's grounds, and Dearing could still see his friend's cigar
      intermittently glowing as the student, philosopher, and successful
      financier strode back and forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows? Kenneth may be right, after all,&rdquo; Dearing mused, bitterly. &ldquo;At
      such moments as this one wonders if there really can be a God who is
      justly ruling the universe. What has poor little Madge done, in her gentle
      purity, to merit this crushing blow? It was her very trusting innocence
      that brought it upon her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was one of Dealing's habits to say his prayers at night on retiring,
      and when he had disrobed he knelt by his bedside. But somehow the words
      failed to come as readily as had been their wont; he was trying to pray
      for the relief of his sister, but reason kept telling him that it was a
      futile appeal. God had not hindered the approach of the calamity; why
      should mere human appeal immediately lift it? So he said his &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; sooner
      than usual, and with a brain hot over the memory of Walton's looks and
      words, he rolled and tossed on a sleepless bed till far into the night.

      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Fred Walton
      left Dearing's office, he went along the street toward his father's home.
      He walked slowly, absolute despair showing itself in the droop of his
      powerful body, and in the helpless, animal glare of his eyes. He had
      reached a point from which, the street being on a slight elevation, he
      could see the old house in which he was born. He paused. All about him was
      peace, stillness, and incongruous content. The town clock, capping the
      brick stand-pipe of the waterworks, struck nine solemn strokes, and he
      could feel the after-vibrations of the mellow metal as the sound died
      away. He turned, leaving his home on the left, and walked on aimlessly
      till the houses which bordered the way became more scattered, and then he
      reached a bridge which spanned a little river. A full moon was rising.
      Through the foliage of the near-by trees it looked like a world of fire
      away off in space. Its red rays fell on the swiftly rushing water,
      throwing on its surface a path of flaming blood. He went out on the
      structure, and leaned against the iron railing. Just beyond the end of the
      bridge rose a green-clad hill. It had a high fence around it, and a wide
      gateway with a white, crescent-shaped sign above it. It was the Stafford
      cemetery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I ought to see it once more before I go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It will be the
      last time&mdash;the very last; and surely, though I'll blush in her dead
      presence, <i>thief</i> as <i>I</i> am, I ought to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He crossed to the other side, and went into the gate of the enclosure.
      Threading his way among the monuments, his brow reverently bared to the
      solemn moonlight, he came to a square plot surrounded by an ivy-coated
      brick wall with a granite coping. It contained several graves bearing his
      name, but only one engaged his attention. He sat down on its footstone,
      and, with his head still bare, he remained motionless for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn't know the son she used to be so proud of would ever come to
      this,&rdquo; he said, bitterly. &ldquo;With all her hopes and prayers, she little knew
      that I'd be an outcast&mdash;actually forced to flee from the law; she
      little dreamed it would come to that when she used to talk of the great
      and good things I was to do. Poor, dear, little mother! You'd rather be
      dead than alive to-night. I wonder if it is <i>absolutely too late?</i>
      Perhaps, far away, under a new name and among strangers, I may be able to
      live differently. And if I could, she would know and be glad. Mother,
      listen, dear!&rdquo; A sob rose in him, and shook him from head to foot. &ldquo;The
      wrong I did was done when my brain was turned by liquor, and I did not
      realize my danger till it was too late; I swear here&mdash;right here&mdash;to
      you, dear little mother, that from this moment on I'll try to be better. I
      may fail, but I'll try. I swear, too, that from this moment on I'll bend
      every energy of my soul and body to the undoing of the thing of which I am
      guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood up. Ten solemn strokes of the town clock rang out on the profound
      stillness. The air was vibrant with a myriad insect voices from the
      marshes along the river. Rays of lamplight shot across the shrubbery
      between the shafts and the slabs of stone. They came from a window in the
      cottage of the sexton of the cemetery. The lone visitor saw a shaggy head
      of hair, a long, ragged beard the color of the clay beneath the soil, and
      a rugged face, gashed and seamed by time. The old man was smoking&mdash;placidly
      smoking. Even a humble digger of graves could be content, while this
      young, vigorous soul was steeped in the dregs of despair. Walton turned
      away, slowly retraced his steps to the outside, crossed the river, and,
      careful to avoid meeting any one, he finally came again to his father's
      house. It was dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might get in at a window and bring away a few things to wear,&rdquo; he
      reflected. &ldquo;But no, I must not risk it. He might meet me face to face and
      demand the truth. I'd have to tell him. Sharp of sight, and suspicious as
      he now is, he would read it in my face, and order my arrest. Yes, he would
      do it. He is my father, but he would do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On he went, now headed for the square. Reaching the bank, the thought
      occurred to him that, having a key, he would go in and write a note to his
      father. A moment later he had locked himself within the stifling place,
      and under a flaring gas-jet, and seated on the high office-stool at a
      desk, he wrote as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      My Dear Father,&mdash;Surprised though you've never been at my numerous
      bad acts, you will be now at what I am about to confess. For more than a
      week I have been covering up a shortage in my account which amounts to
      more than you can afford to lose without warning. I am five thousand
      dollars behind, and am absolutely unable to replace it. I shall make no
      excuses. Being your son gave me no right to the money, but taking it at a
      time when I believed it would save me in a certain speculation in futures,
      I told myself that I had the right, as your son and heir, to borrow it.
      That I looked at it that way, and was half intoxicated at the time the
      deed was committed, is all that I can say by way of palliation of my
      offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      You once said to me that if I ever did anything of this sort that you
      would turn me over to the law exactly as you would any stranger, and I
      understand you well enough to know that you will keep your word. You would
      do it in your anger, even if you regretted it afterward; so, father, I am
      leaving home to-night, never to return. Don't think I am taking any more
      of your money, either, for I am not. I am leaving without a penny. I don't
      know where I shall go, but I am starting out into the world to try to
      begin life anew. You have always contended that my hopes of inheriting
      your savings was the prime cause of my failure, and that had I been forced
      to struggle for myself, as you had to do as a young man, I should have
      known the true value of money. I believe you are right, and to-night, as I
      am leaving, a certain hope comes to me that maybe there is enough of your
      sterling energy in me to make a man of me <i>eventually</i>. Perhaps it
      won't count much with you for me to say that I am going to try to be
      straight and honorable from now on. You never have had faith in my
      promises, but you have never seen me tried as I shall be tried. I know how
      much I owe you to a cent, and as fast as I earn money&mdash;if I <i>can</i>
      earn any&mdash;it shall be sent back to you, and, if I live, I shall wipe
      out the debt which now stands against me. I wish I could put my arms round
      your neck to-night and beg your forgiveness before I go, but you'd not
      trust me. In your fury over your loss you'd not give me the chance I must
      have to redeem myself, and this is the only way. But, oh, father, <i>do,
      do</i> give me this last chance! For the sake of my mother's memory, and
      your name, which I have tarnished, don't try to hunt me down like a common
      thief! I want one more opportunity. <i>Do, do</i>, give it to me!
      Good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Folding the sheets on which he had written, Walton put them into an
      envelope and placed it on his father's desk. He was now ready to go, but
      paused again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't write to Margaret,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have promised not to. Her brother
      will tell her enough, anyway, to make her ashamed that she ever knew me;
      but there is poor Dora&mdash;my dear, trusting friend. I must not go
      without a line to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seated himself again, and wrote as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      My Dear Little Friend,&mdash;You have said several times of late that you
      feared I had some burden on my mind because I was not as cheerful as I
      used to be. Well, your sharp, kindly eyes were reading a truth I was
      trying to conceal. I have got myself into most serious trouble. I haven't
      the heart to go into details over it; I need not, anyway, for my father
      will let it out soon enough. Every tongue in old Stafford will wag and
      clatter over the final finish of the town's daredevil to-morrow. And it
      will pain you, too, for of all my friends, young as you are, you were my
      soundest adviser. You used to say that I'd soon sow my wild oats, and
      settle down and make a man of myself. You used to say, too, that I'd
      finally win the girl who&mdash;but, disgraced as I am, I won't mention her
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have lost her forever, dear Dora. She may have cared a little for me,
      but she won't when she knows how low I've fallen. I am going far away to
      try to hew out some sort of a new road. I may fail, as I have always
      failed, but if I do, my failure will not be added to the list of my
      shortcomings here in Stafford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, dear Dora, forgive me for speaking of something concerning you. For
      the last month, though I did not mention it, I have been afraid that all
      was not going quite well with you, either. You almost admitted it once
      when I caught you crying. You remember, it was the evening I met Kenneth
      Galt and you in the wood back of your house&mdash;the evening your mother,
      you remember, thought you had been out with me, and scolded us both. I saw
      plainly that you did not want her to know you had met him, and so I said
      nothing; but the thing has troubled me a great deal, I'll admit. I really
      know nothing seriously against the man, but he has queer, almost too
      modern, views in regard to love, and I think, dear Dora, that maybe you
      have imbibed some of them. Secret association like that cannot be best for
      a young girl, and so I feel that I can't go away without just this little
      warning. He is a wealthy man of the world, and his friendship with a
      sweet, pure girl like you are ought to be open and aboveboard. You are
      rarely beautiful, dear Dora. Your painting shows that you are a genius.
      You have a great future before you; don't spoil it all by becoming too
      much interested in this man. It may appeal to your romantic side to meet
      him like that, but it can't&mdash;simply <i>can't</i> be best. Now, you
      will forgive your &ldquo;big brother,&rdquo; won't you? I may never come back; I may
      never even write, but I shall often think lovingly of you, dear friend.
      Good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had signed, sealed, and directed the letter, he put a stamp on it
      and went out and closed the bank, pushing the key back into the room
      through a crack beneath the shutter. He then slowly crossed the deserted
      square to the post-office on the corner and deposited the letter. After
      this he stood with his strong arms folded, looking about irresolutely. In
      front of him lay the town's single line of horse-cars, which led to the
      railway station half a mile distant. One of the cars stood in front of
      him. It had made its last slow and jangling trip to meet the nine-o'clock
      north-bound train. The track stretched out before him, the worn bars
      gleaming like threads of silver in the moonlight. Casting one other look
      about him, and heaving a deep sigh, he lowered his head and started for
      the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think this is Jack Thomas' run,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;If it is, he will take
      me aboard.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      REACHING the depot in the edge of the town where there were only three or
      four cottages, a hotel of the lowest class, and a negro dive masquerading
      as a restaurant, at which fried spring chicken, hot biscuits, and a cup of
      coffee were advertised on a crude placard for twenty-five cents, he met
      few signs of wakefulness. At a switch near a water-tank with a dripping
      spout a watchman stood with a dingy lantern. Walton moved over to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;South-bound freight on time?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked at him indifferently. &ldquo;I heard her blow at the crossing,&rdquo;
       he answered. &ldquo;There! can't you hear her rumble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's the conductor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack Thomas, if he didn't lay over at Red Hill to spend Sunday with his
      folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to speak to him. Where will his cab stop?&rdquo; The man had filled his
      short pipe, and he took the globe off his lantern to light it. &ldquo;The engine
      will water here at the tank,&rdquo; he said, gruffly. &ldquo;The cab will stop down
      near the tool-house on account of the length of the train&mdash;a lot of
      empty fruit-cars going South.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; thank you.&rdquo; Walton moved away, and leaned against a stack of
      cross-ties near the tool-house. He could now quite clearly hear the rumble
      of the coming train. There was a wide stretch of old cotton and corn
      fields, now barren and out of use, between him and the train, and across
      them presently shot the wavering gleam of the engine's headlight. On it
      came, growing larger and steadier till it had passed him, and with the
      harsh creaking of brakes on massive, groaning wheels the locomotive came
      to a stop. The side door of the caboose was open. A man holding a lantern
      lightly swung himself to the ground, and peered up at a brake-man on the
      roof of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unwind her, and run to the other end!&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;You needn't hang
      around my cab all night. I haven't a drop to drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Cap,&rdquo; and, jumping from car to car on the foot-boards
      overhead, the brakeman disappeared in the cloud of steam and smoke which
      the locomotive was belching forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Jack!&rdquo; Walton came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! Good Lord, Fred, what are you doing down here this time of night?
      I thought you fellows had a game on every Sunday. I was just wishing I had
      enough boodle ahead to lay over and walk away with some Stafford coin. I
      want to get even for the last hold-up you blacklegs gave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm dead broke, Jack, old man,&rdquo; Walton said, avoiding the eyes of his
      friend. &ldquo;I want to get to Atlanta before the morning train, and I wondered&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I'd take you? Of course I will. I'm sorry to hear you are broke,
      though, for we might pass the time with a game. It's down-grade,&rdquo; he
      laughed, impulsively; &ldquo;we might turn old No. 12 over to the fireman, and
      get the engineer and brakeman to come in and try a round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't trust myself with three railroad men,&rdquo; Walton tried to jest,
      &ldquo;even if I hadn't sworn off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! again? Oh, that <i>is</i> a joke!&rdquo; Thomas laughed. &ldquo;You Stafford
      chaps say you swear off, then practice night and day, and stick it to the
      first galoot that comes along. Oh, I am on!&rdquo; There was a sound of rushing
      water from the tank ahead. In the dim light in the locomotive they could
      see the fireman on the tender astride of the swinging pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you will take me along, Jack,&rdquo; Walton replied. &ldquo;I want to get to
      Atlanta, and haven't a cent on earth. The truth is, I am in bad shape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard you sing that song before,&rdquo; the conductor replied, with an
      incredulous smile. He raised his lantern till the yellow light fell on
      Walton's face, and he stared in astonishment. &ldquo;Why, really, you <i>do</i>
      look kind o' bunged up. What's the matter, old chap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm simply down and out, Jack, that's the sum and substance of it. I am
      down and out. When do you start?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a minute. I've got to run clean round the train and examine my
      door-seals. Climb in. I'll swing on as we leave the yard. Make yourself
      comfortable. Huh! you are done for, eh? That <i>is</i> a joke!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Climbing the iron step, Walton found himself in the caboose. It was dimly
      lighted by a lamp in a curved tin holder on the wall over a crude desk
      with pigeonholes. Here the conductor kept a pencil tied to a string, and
      some yellow blanks for reports and telegrams. There was a hard, smooth,
      backless bench near the door, and a narrow cot with wooden sides and ends.
      On an inverted box stood a tin pitcher, a wash-basin, and a cake of coarse
      yellow soap. On a hook hung a soiled towel; a pair of blue overalls, a
      white shirt, and a tattered raincoat were suspended at the sport of the
      wind and motion of the car on other hooks along the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a harsh, snarling sound as the hinged water-pipe was drawn up on
      its chains; the clanging of a bell; the shriek of the locomotive's
      whistle; a quickening succession of jerks, communicated from bumper to
      bumper, and the train was off. Walton was glad to be alone with the
      desolate pain that clutched him now with renewed force. He wanted no human
      eye to witness his misery. Away off there, beyond the hills, in its shroud
      of mystic moonlight, lay the town he now loved with a yearning which all
      but tore his heart from his body. He was looking at the old place for the
      last time unless, unless&mdash;and his blood ran cold at the thought&mdash;unless
      he was brought back by the officers of the law to answer for his crime.
      Yes, that might be his fate, after all. A city so well policed as Atlanta
      would prove a poor hiding-place for a penniless fugitive. A telegram from
      Stafford would put the authorities on the alert, and escape would be
      impossible. And no sentimental reasons would check prompt action on the
      part of old Simon Walton. In his rage over the discovery of the unexpected
      loss of such a large amount of ever-needed cash, he would balk at nothing.
      Of family pride he had little&mdash;certainly not pride strong enough to
      make him a party to the concealment of crime, even in his own blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I have to be the daddy of a thief,&rdquo; Fred imagined his saying, &ldquo;I'd
      rather be the daddy of one under lock and key, where he could be
      controlled like any other sort of maniac.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he must make good his escape, the young man reflected; there was no
      other way. Escape meant a chance, at least, for reformation and atonement,
      and he must reform&mdash;he must atone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train was rounding a curve. A sudden and deeper pain shot through him,
      for on a hill, in a grove not far off, he saw the roof, gables, windows,
      and walls of a country house he well knew. It was there, at a house-party,
      that he had been thrown for the first time with Margaret Dearing and had
      learned to love her. His eyes were blinded by tears he could not restrain
      as he tried to descry the exact spot among the trees where he and she had
      sat that glorious morning in early autumn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God have mercy!&rdquo; He leaned against the side of the car and groaned. Even
      now she knew of his ruin. Her brother had already prepared her for the
      news, which would spread through the town like wild-fire. She knew, and
      her proud brow was burning under the shame of having trusted a coward and
      a knave to the extent of having had her name coupled with his. He stood in
      the centre of the car, swayed back and forth by its ruthless motion. Those
      merciless wheels, grinding so close beneath, would end it all. It would be
      an easy thing to swing himself under the car door till he was over the
      rail and then let go&mdash;<i>let go!</i> He shuddered, and turned cold
      from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a thumping overhead as some one leaped from the roof of the car
      ahead to that of the caboose. There was a scraping of soles and heels on
      the tin covering, a step on the iron ladder by the door, and the conductor
      lunged into the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got on by the very skin of my teeth,&rdquo; he said, with a merry oath. &ldquo;We are
      on the down-grade, and we started quick. But why don't you take a seat?&rdquo;
       He raised his lantern, and the rays fell full on Walton's pallid face.
      &ldquo;Say, old man, are you as hard hit as all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It couldn't be harder, Jack,&rdquo; Walton said. &ldquo;I am at the end of my rope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am sorry&mdash;I'm real sorry,&rdquo; the conductor declared. &ldquo;I'll
      tell you what to do. It's a tough ride to Atlanta, along with our stops
      and sidings and waits on through trains. There won't be a soul in the bunk
      to-night. Throw off your things and crawl in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that's <i>your</i> bed,&rdquo; Walton protested, thoughtful, even in his
      misery, of his friend's comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for to-night it isn't,&rdquo; Thomas affirmed, as he hung up his lantern
      and drew a stool to the desk. &ldquo;I've got to be up till daybreak. Crawl in,
      I tell you!&rdquo; Walton sat down on the edge of the cot, a trembling hand went
      to his necktie. In the rays of the yellow light he looked as though he
      were about to faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, wait!&rdquo; Thomas chuckled. &ldquo;I'll physic you all right.&rdquo; He raised
      the top of his desk and drew out a flask of whiskey. &ldquo;It is actually the
      smoothest article that ever slid down a human throat,&rdquo; he laughed, as he
      shook the flask and extended it to his guest. &ldquo;Take a pull at it, and you
      will have dreams of Paradise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care for it right now, Jack,&rdquo; Walton returned. &ldquo;I may ask for it
      later. Whiskey always keeps me awake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I've got to sit up,&rdquo; the conductor said, &ldquo;so here's looking at you.
      I've got the dandiest thirst that mortal ever owned. You've heard about
      the feller who told the prohibitionist that he didn't want to get rid of
      his. Well, I'm that way about mine. If a man went round paying for
      thirsts, he couldn't buy mine for all the money in the State. I've got it
      trained till it walks a chalk-line. I go without a drink sometimes for
      days at a time, just so she will get good and ripe and have a sort of
      clinging rasp on her. But no joking, old man, I don't like your looks.
      I've seen you kind of blue before, but I never saw you plumb flabbergasted
      like this. You say you are broke. I don't happen to have anything in my
      pocket right now, but I reckon I could draw a little pay in advance from
      our agent in Atlanta, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to borrow any money, Jack, thank you just the same,&rdquo; Walton
      said. &ldquo;When I get to Atlanta I'll look around and see what will turn up.&rdquo;
       And, stifling a groan of despair, he sank back on the cot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, old man,&rdquo; the conductor responded. &ldquo;Now, go to sleep. You need
      rest.&rdquo; He turned the wick of the lamp down and pushed his lantern into a
      corner, so that its light would not fall on the face of his guest. Then he
      slid the bench to the open door, lighted his pipe, and fell into a revery.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE cot was hard
      and narrow, and it had sides of unpadded boards. For hours Fred lay
      pretending to be asleep, that he might shirk the sheer torture of
      conversation with his friend. Through partly closed eyelids he watched the
      railroad man as he sat in the doorway looking out at the rapidly shifting
      night view. When a station was reached the conductor would spring up, and
      with his lantern swinging in his hand he would descend to the ground and
      wave his light or call out an order to a switchman or the man at the
      brakes. Then the creaking, mechanical reptile would crawl along and speed
      away again. Several times the miserable passenger dozed off into most
      delectable dreams. In them he was always with Margaret in some fragrant
      spot among flowers, by flowing streams, and in wondrous sunshine. Once he
      saw General Sylvester and his grim old father in congenial converse
      together, while he and Margaret stood hand in hand near by, and then his
      beautiful, haughty sweetheart put her arms about the grizzled neck of the
      man who had never known affection and kissed him. But she was fading away,
      as was the erect old soldier, and the dreamer found himself before his
      father at the old man's desk in the bank. And now Simon Walton's face was
      dark as night. A ledger lay open before him. &ldquo;Five thousand dollars of my
      hard-earned money!&rdquo; the old man shrieked. &ldquo;And you deliberately stole it
      from my vault! Thief! Thief! Thief!&rdquo; Simon's lips continued to move, but
      no sound save a dismal, mechanical rumbling issued. There was a long
      scream of the steam-whistle, a thunderous bumping of cars one against
      another, the rasping rattle of brake-chains, a glare of yellow light, and
      Fred saw Thomas standing over him, his lantern's rays thrown downward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the yard at last, old chap,&rdquo; the conductor said, as he took his
      lantern apart and blew out the flame, &ldquo;but don't you get up. You haven't
      had enough sleep, and it is only five o'clock. You didn't rest well in
      that blamed bunk. You kept rolling and jabbering in your sleep. I've got
      to run up-town, but the cab will stand right here on the side-track all
      day, and you can leave it whenever you like. I'll be about the general
      freight-office till noon, and if you want me, look me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. You are mighty good, Jack,&rdquo; the wanderer said, appalled and
      stupefied by his sudden awakening to the grim reality of his condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the conductor had left, and unable, through sheer mental agony, to go
      back to sleep, Walton crawled out of the bunk and stood up. His legs,
      arms, and neck were stiff, and twinges of pain darted through his muscles
      as he moved. Standing in the open door, he looked out over the vast
      stretch of railway tracks. The gray light of dawn shrouded everything.
      Over the tops of cars, heaps of old scrap-iron, blinking vari-colored
      signal-lights, and bridges which spanned the tracks he saw the
      spectre-like outlines of the State Capitol's drab dome, and farther to the
      left the tall office-buildings in the centre of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then a man came round the end of the car, and, with a start of
      surprise, recognized him. It was a railway mail-carrier who had once lived
      at Stafford. &ldquo;Why, hello, Fred!&rdquo; he cried, rubbing his eyes, for he had
      just risen from his bed. &ldquo;What are you doing down this way at break of
      day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walton hesitated; a tinge of color came into his pale face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ran down for a trip with Jack Thomas,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;this is his cab.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;I see. Where <i>is</i> Jack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had to go up-town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't had your breakfast yet, I'll bet. Come on and take a snack
      with me. There is a good all-night eating-house up by the Viaduct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, I've got to hang around here for a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so long!&rdquo; the man said, with a backward look of perplexity, as he
      moved away. &ldquo;I'll see you uptown, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walton stood down on the ground and looked about him; then he saw
      something that drove him back into the car. It was a policeman in uniform
      a hundred yards away. He seemed to emerge from the cattle-yard on the
      left, and was walking along slowly, looking under cars and trying their
      sliding doors. He would stoop to the cross-ties and peer carefully at the
      trucks, and move on again to repeat the process at each car of the long
      train, the engine of which was fired for leaving. Walton sank to a seat on
      the cot; the man was searching for him. There would be no escape.
      Presently a feeling of relief came to him in the reflection that his fears
      were ungrounded, for his father, not having read the letter he had left on
      his desk, could not yet know of his flight. The old man never went to the
      bank earlier than eight in the morning, and it could not now be later than
      five. Yes, the officer was looking for some one else. The fugitive
      breathed more freely for a few minutes; then another shock quickly
      followed the first. It was now plain&mdash;horribly plain. His father,
      having sent him to the bank for a statement of his account the evening
      before, had waited up for him, his impatience and suspicion growing as the
      hours passed. Old Simon could not have slept while a matter of that nature
      remained unsettled. He had waited, pacing the floor of his room, till
      nine; till ten; till eleven; and then, full of gravest alarm as to the
      safety of his funds, he had gone down to the bank to ascertain the cause
      of the delay. In his mind's eye, Fred saw the grim old financier as he
      stalked muttering through the silent streets of the slumbering town. He
      saw him open the big door of the bank, and heard his disappointed growl as
      he faced the darkness. Old Simon, with fumbling hands, found and struck a
      match; then he groped his way back to his office and lighted the gas. Fred
      saw him as he stared round the room, and, with the gasp of an animal,
      pounced on the letter he had written; he saw, as if he had been on the
      spot, the distorted, terrified face of the bewildered old miser. Then what
      had he done? He had gone quaking and whimpering to the home of the sheriff
      near by; he had waked the officer by pounding on the door, and ordered the
      immediate pursuit of his son as an absconding thief. The telegram had left
      Stafford before midnight; it had passed the fugitive as he slept, and the
      policeman now looking under the cars was only one of scores who were bent
      upon hunting him down. Yes, it was all over. There was nothing left now
      but to be taken back to Stafford, handcuffed as a common felon. He crept
      to the car door and looked out. The policeman had paused in his search,
      and was coming directly across to him. A feeling of odd and almost
      soothing resignation came over the young man; at any rate, he would not
      hide like a coward. He was guilty, and he would take his punishment. So he
      sank upon the bench at the door and calmly eyed the officer as he crossed
      the tracks, playfully swinging the polished club which was strapped to his
      wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning!&rdquo; the man said, looking up. &ldquo;You are not the conductor of
      this train, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Fred answered, wonderingly; &ldquo;he's just gone up-town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The policeman swung his club. &ldquo;Got a match in your pocket? I want to smoke
      so bad I can taste it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walton fumbled in his pocket and produced some matches, and, still
      wondering, he reached over and put them into the extended hand. The man in
      uniform was young, clear of skin and eye, and had a good face&mdash;a face
      which Walton no longer dreaded, which, indeed, he felt that he could like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tough job I'm on now, you can bet your life,&rdquo; the policeman said, as he
      struck the match on the iron ladder of the car and applied it to a
      half-smoked cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of job is it?&rdquo; Walton asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you see,&rdquo; the man explained, &ldquo;the railroads of the State have had no
      end of trouble with hoboes here lately. The dirty tramps are forever
      stealing rides. At this time of year they are as thick as flies on the
      trucks, brakes, and bumpers. They fall off when they get to sleep, and are
      killed; they break in the cars, and steal the freight; and a gang of them
      have been known to throw rocks at the train-crew, and raise hell
      generally. So, as a last resort, the roads determined to make cases
      against every one that could be caught, and they are sending them up by
      the hundreds, and for good long terms, too. They are never able to pay the
      fines, you see, and they have to work it out in the coal-mines or
      turpentine camps. Now and then a big mistake is made, of course; for many
      a good man has been sent up for only trying to reach a place where he
      could get honest employment. But the law is no respecter of persons. Let a
      man without money to pay his fine be caught stealing a ride through <i>this</i>
      town, and nothing in God's world will save him. The feathers of a
      jail-bird stick mighty tight, you know, and after one gets out he never
      makes any headway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not well treated, either, I have heard,&rdquo; Walton put in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet they are not,&rdquo; the policeman said, looking across the tracks.
      &ldquo;Gee! did you see that? I think I've got one now. I saw a fellow peep out
      right over there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He darted off, club in hand, and Walton saw him disappear between two
      cars, and heard his stern voice cry: &ldquo;Come out of there, young man! Don't
      make me crawl under after you! Come on, the game is up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walton descended to the ground and crossed over to the policeman just as a
      young man with a grimy face and tousled hair emerged from behind the heavy
      wheels. He did not appear to be more than twenty years of age, and his
      clothing, even to his hat and necktie, indicated that he was not an
      ordinary tramp. He stared in a bewildered way at the blue coat, brass
      buttons, and helmet-shaped hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake, don't send me up, policeman!&rdquo; he pleaded, in a piteous
      tone. &ldquo;I am out of money, and want to get through by way of New Orleans to
      Oklahoma. I am out of work and trying to reach Gate City, where I can get
      a job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got nothing to do with that,&rdquo; the policeman said, curtly. &ldquo;I'm put
      here to arrest you fellows&mdash;that's my duty, and I've caught you in
      the act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God, have mercy!&rdquo; Walton heard the boy muttering to himself. &ldquo;I can't
      stand it! I'd rather die, and be done with it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the officer again, and his lips seemed to be trying to frame
      some further appeal, but, as if realizing the utter futility of such a
      course, he simply hung his head and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walton, who liked the boy's looks, suddenly felt a rebellious impulse rise
      and struggle within him. It was the quality which, in spite of his faults,
      had endeared him to his many friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, old man,&rdquo; he said to the policeman, &ldquo;law or no law, duty or no
      duty, you can't take the responsibility of this thing on your shoulders.
      I'm a fair judge of men, and I am sure it would be wrong to send this boy
      up. You know he is only doing what you or I would do if hard luck drove us
      to it. Say, old man, I'm dead broke myself, I haven't a dollar in my
      pocket, and I am out of a job besides; but I've got a good solid gold
      watch in my pocket, and if you will let him go I'll give it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer wavered; he stared, speechless, for a moment, colored high,
      then shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon my duty <i>does</i> allow me to sorter discriminate,&rdquo; he
      faltered. &ldquo;I haven't seen the chap actually riding, either. But I won't
      take any bribes&mdash;I wouldn't take one from <i>you</i>, anyway. You are
      about as white a chap as I've run across in many a day, and I'm going to
      drop the dang thing. God knows, I don't want your watch! But, say, don't
      get <i>me</i> into trouble. I've got a family to support, and I must hold
      my job. Get the fellow out of the freight-yards before the town wakes up.
      There are cops on our force who would drag him in by the heels. Car-grease
      like he's got smeared all over him is a dead give-away. Say, young man,
      take a fool's advice: get out on the country roads. You'll make it all
      right among the farms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't take the watch, then?&rdquo; Fred held the timepiece toward him, its
      golden chain swinging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't want it. But hurry up! Get him out of the yards!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, and I'll show you the way,&rdquo; Walton said to the boy, when the
      officer had gone. And without a word, so overjoyed was he by the sudden
      turn in his favor, the begrimed youth dumbly followed his rescuer across
      the tracks to a quiet little street bordered by diminutive cottages.
    </p>
    <p>
      On they trudged through street after street till, just as the first rays
      of sunlight were breaking through the clouds, they found the open country
      before them. For miles and miles it stretched away to blue hills in the
      vague, misty distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can make out all right now,&rdquo; the boy said, with a grateful glance at
      his rescuer, as they paused. &ldquo;I don't want to take you farther out of your
      way. God knows, I'll not forget your kindness till my dying day. You don't
      know what you've saved me from. I'd have killed myself rather than be sent
      up. I've heard what those places are like. If you will tell me your name
      and where your home is, I'll write back to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walton's eyes met those of his companion. &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he said, gloomily, &ldquo;I'm
      as homeless as you are, my boy. The truth is, I don't know where to turn,
      myself, and really the thought of parting with you, for some reason or
      other, hurts me. I need a companion worse than I ever did in my life. Say,
      will you let me go with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Will</i> I?&rdquo; and the grimy face filled with emotion, the big brown
      eyes glistened with unshed tears. &ldquo;God knows, I'd rather have you than any
      one else, and I certainly am lonely enough!&rdquo; The blackened hand went out
      and clasped Walton's, and, face to face, these new friends in adversity
      stood and silently vowed fidelity. &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; Fred asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick Warren,&rdquo; the younger said. &ldquo;I am from Kentucky&mdash;Louisville.
      I've got no close kin, and no money. I was a telegraph operator in Memphis
      till a month ago, but lost my job. Long-distance telephone is killing my
      business. I heard of Gate City&mdash;they say it is booming. I want to go
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll join you,&rdquo; Walton said. &ldquo;I've heard of it, too. Those, new towns are
      all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't tell me your name,&rdquo; Dick suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I forgot; why, it's Fred&mdash;it's Frederic Spencer.&rdquo; He had given
      the seldom-used part of his Christian name, that of his maternal
      grandfather. &ldquo;Some day I'll tell you all about myself, but not now&mdash;not
      now. Are you hungry, Dick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy nodded slowly. It looked as if he were afraid that an admission of
      the whole truth might further discommode his new friend. &ldquo;A little bit,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;but I can make out for a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll try a farm-house farther on,&rdquo; Walton said, with an appreciative
      glance at the weary face before him. &ldquo;I'll have to have a cup of coffee or
      I'll drop in my tracks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sun, now above the tree-tops, was beginning to beat fiercely upon
      them, and threatening much in the way of heat and sultry temperature later
      in the day. The activity of his mind and sympathies in behalf of his
      companion had in a measure dulled Walton's sense of his own condition, but
      as he trudged along by his companion the whole circumstance of his flight
      and the far-reaching consequences of his act came upon him anew. The agony
      within him now seemed to ooze from his body like a material substance,
      clogging his utterance and shackling his feet.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HAT morning, about
      nine o'clock, old Simon Walton rode down to his bank in the one-horse
      buggy of antiquated type which had come into his possession years before
      in the foreclosure of a mortgage given by a poor farmer, and which, with
      its rusty springs and uncouth appearance, was quite in keeping with the
      character of its present owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bookkeepers were busy at their special duties, and scarcely gave him a
      glance over their ponderous ledgers as he came in at the front and walked
      to his desk in the rear. Hanging up his old slouch hat, and seating
      himself in his big revolving chair, his eyes fell on a stack of letters
      addressed to him. Rapidly shifting them through his stiff fingers, his
      attention was drawn to the only one which bore no stamp or postmark. He
      recognized the writing, and as he held it frowningly before him, his
      confidential clerk, Toby Lassiter, a colorless and bald young man of
      medium height, sparse mutton-chop whiskers, and soft, shrinking gray eyes,
      entered with a slip of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cotton quotations you wanted, Mr. Walton,&rdquo; he said, in the discreet
      tone he used to the banker on all occasions, lest he might by accident
      expose to other ears matters his cautious master wished to be kept
      private.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes.&rdquo; Then, as Lassiter was softly slipping away: &ldquo;But hold on, Toby!
      Have you seen Fred this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, he hasn't been around yet. In fact, Mr. Walton, I wanted to ask
      you. Only three of us carry keys to the front door&mdash;you and me and
      Fred; and when I was opening up this morning I found that somebody had
      pushed one of them under the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I've got <i>mine</i>,&rdquo; old Simon said, with a slow, wondering
      stare. &ldquo;Oh, wait! this note is from him; maybe he&mdash;&rdquo; The banker, with
      fumbling fingers, tore open the envelope and began to read. The waiting
      clerk heard him utter a gasp. It was followed by a low, subdued groan, and
      looking like a corpse momentarily electrified into a semblance of life,
      the old man rose to his feet, the half-read confession clutched in his
      sinewy fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's gone!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;He's taken five thousand dollars of the bank's
      funds, and made off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Walton, do, <i>do</i> be quiet!&rdquo; Lassiter whispered, warningly,
      as he laid his hands on the arms of his employer, and gently urged him to
      sit down. The banker obeyed as an automaton might, his wrinkled face
      beneath his shaggy eyebrows wildly distorted, his lips parted, showing his
      yellow jagged teeth, his breath coming and going in spasmodic gasps. Every
      hair on his head seemed to stand dry and harsh by itself as he ran his
      prong-like fingers upward through the bushy mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five thousand&mdash;five thousand&mdash;five thousand!&rdquo; he groaned; &ldquo;the
      low, ungrateful thief; and at a time when he knew it would hamper us and
      maybe bring on a crash. Look y' here, Toby, and be quick about it! Run and
      get the sheriff&mdash;if you can't find him fetch the deputy! Then see if
      the telegraph office is open. I'll jail that scamp before night! I want my
      money! I want my money! He's no son of mine! I gave him fair warning, as
      you know, to let up in his damnable course, and he snapped his
      card-flipping fingers in my face. Hurry up! He can't be far off; we'll nab
      him before the day is over. Run!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the clerk lingered. &ldquo;Mr. Walton,&rdquo; he began, falteringly, &ldquo;I never have
      refused to obey your orders, but Fred ain't quite as bad as&mdash;really,
      you oughtn't to handle the boy that way. He's been a good friend to me,
      and I'd hate to think I'd stand by and see you take a step like this, mad
      as you are, when if you'd only be calm a minute, surely you'd realize&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I the head of this bank or <i>you?</i>&rdquo; old Walton broke in, as he
      rose and stood quivering and clinging with both hands to the back of his
      unsteady chair. &ldquo;Go and do as I tell you, or, by the God over our heads,
      I'll send you about your business!&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Mr. Walton,&rdquo; the clerk yielded, &ldquo;I'll do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      White as death could have made him, Lassiter passed out at a door on the
      side of the building and gained the street without being seen by the
      workers in the counting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Fred!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;He's too good at heart to be treated this way,
      and he's not a <i>real</i> thief, either. Folks have told him all his life
      that he had a right to more of the old man's money than he was getting,
      and he didn't think it was stealing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On a corner he saw Bill Johnston, the sheriff, a man about forty-five
      years of age, who wore great heavy top-boots, a broad-brimmed hat, and had
      sharp brown eyes and a waxed and twisted mustache. With considerable
      reluctance, Toby went up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Walton wants to see you, Bill,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He's in his office in the
      bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I can't come for ten minutes yet, anyway,&rdquo; the sheriff said, not
      removing his steady gaze from a group of men round a mountain wagon in a
      vacant lot across the street, where, on a high hoarding of planks, glaring
      new circus bills were posted. &ldquo;The boys are about to smell out a keg of
      wild-cat whiskey in that gang of mossbacks. They may need me any minute.
      Tell the old man I'll be along as soon as I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lassiter went back to the bank and gained his employer's presence without
      attracting the attention of any of the clerks. He found the shaggy head
      prone on the desk, the long arms hanging down at either side. For a moment
      Toby thought the banker was a victim of heart-failure, and stood stricken
      with horror. But he was reassured by a low groan from the almost inert
      human mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord,&rdquo; he heard the banker praying, &ldquo;scourge him! Don't heed his
      cries and promises! He has lied to me, he'll lie to you!&rdquo; Therewith Simon
      raised his blearing eyes, now fixed and bloodshot in their sockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he growled, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johnston is coming right away,&rdquo; Lassiter said, and he approached the old
      man and leaned over him. &ldquo;Mr. Walton, once when you were very mad with the
      other bank, you remember, and was about to take action against them, I got
      your ear, and showed you that in a suit at court you'd have to make
      certain showings of a private nature that would injure our interests, and
      you admitted that I was right, and&mdash;and decided to let the matter
      blow over. You've said several times since then that I was right, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what the devil has that got to do with <i>this?</i>&rdquo; Walton
      thundered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you, Mr. Walton&mdash;now wait one minute, just one minute,&rdquo;
       Lassiter urged: &ldquo;you know how excitable depositors are. Don't you see if
      the report goes out that you have actually turned Fred over to the law for
      a big defalcation that folks will get the impression that you are in a
      shaky condition? The other bank would make it appear ten times as bad as
      it is, and we might have a frightful run on us. We are all right, solid
      enough, the Lord knows, but money&mdash;<i>ready</i> money&mdash;is hard
      to get. There never has been a time when it would be as hard to stand
      under a run as right now. We are getting ahead of the other bank, and they
      are as mad as Tucker. They wouldn't want anything better than a chance
      like this to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean?&mdash;great God, Toby, you are right! It would ruin us&mdash;absolutely
      wreck us! I see it&mdash;I see it as plain as day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a sound of heavy steps in the corridor outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the sheriff,&rdquo; Toby whispered, &ldquo;but I didn't tell him what you
      wanted. Don't act now, Mr. Walton; for God's sake, don't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him to wait a minute,&rdquo; the banker panted. But it was too late; the
      sheriff, with his usual lack of ceremony, was already pushing the door
      open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, old man!&rdquo; Johnston said, and he came in with a swinging stride. &ldquo;I
      hope you are not scared about what I owe you; I'll get it up all right.
      Money is owing to me, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it wasn't that&mdash;it wasn't that.&rdquo; Walton's rigid face was forced
      into a smile that fairly distorted it and set the observant officer
      wondering. &ldquo;The truth is, Johnston, I thought I needed your services, but
      I find I'm mistaken. That's all, Johnston, I was mistaken. I've decided to
      let it pass&mdash;to let it pass, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, old man,&rdquo; the sheriff replied, as his puzzled glance swept the
      two disturbed faces before him. &ldquo;I don't care just so you don't garnishee
      my salary for what I owe you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Outside, as he joined a group of idlers on the corner, he remarked, with a
      broad, knowing smile and a twinkle of the eye: &ldquo;That old note-shaver in
      there thinks he can fool me. He sent Toby Lassiter out just now as white
      as a preacher's Sunday shirt to ask me to see him. I found him looking
      like a staring idiot, and was informed that it was a false alarm. False
      nothing! I'll give you boys a tip. I'll bet that gay and festive Fred is
      up to some fresh devilment. You watch out and you'll hear something drop,
      if I am any judge. I saw Fred last night headed for the railroad. He
      didn't see me. I was hiding behind a fence, watching him. I think he
      boarded a freight-train; I am not sure.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>S was only natural
      in a town of the size of Stafford, the sudden departure of Fred Walton,
      under circumstances no one seemed able to explain, caused wide and growing
      comment. A railroad man who had returned from Atlanta informed an eager
      cluster of idlers in the big office of the main hotel of the place that
      Fred had been seen lurking about the freight-yards in the city at early
      daylight, evidently trying to avoid being seen. The report went out, too&mdash;and
      no less authority accompanied it than the word of Fred's stepmother, who,
      admitting the fact that she hated the young man, could not be charged with
      originating a direct lie&mdash;that Fred had gone without &ldquo;a thread to
      wear,&rdquo; except what he had on when leaving. The town did not need to be
      told that in that detail alone lay ample evidence of the gravity of the
      case, even if it were not said&mdash;on good authority, too&mdash;that old
      Simon Walton, immediately on discovering the flight, had called in Bill
      Johnston to consult with him. Had he taken away <i>money?</i> That was the
      question designedly put by Walton's business rivals, and that was the
      question which one and all declared the old man and Toby Lassiter had
      promptly denied. No, it was something else; that was quite plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Barry heard the news at the fence the next afternoon from the voluble
      tongue of a poor washerwoman, a Mrs. Chumley, who, since the downfall of
      her only daughter, and the handsome girl's adoption of a life of
      prostitution in Augusta, had lived on alone in a cottage adjoining Mrs.
      Barry's, and who, as she cleansed the linen of her neighbors for a living,
      besmirched their characters as her only available solace. She was fond of
      hinting darkly that if disgrace had come to her family by <i>discovery</i>,
      it hovered&mdash;ready to drop at any minute&mdash;over the heads of
      people not a bit better, and who were far too stuck-up for their own
      safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly ought to be glad the scamp's gone,&rdquo; she remarked to Mrs.
      Barry, as she leaned her bare, crinkled arms on the fence when she
      unctuously told the news. &ldquo;I never liked to see him hanging round Dora. A
      body would see him one day over there at that big fine house with Miss
      Margaret, whose high-priced ruffles I've got in the tub right now, and the
      next bending his head to enter your lowly door. Things as wide apart as
      them two naturally are won't hitch, neighbor, that's all&mdash;they won't
      hitch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm glad he's gone,&rdquo; Mrs. Barry admitted, with the indiscretion most
      persons had under the plausible eye and guiding tone of the gossip. &ldquo;Dora
      says he had a kind heart, and that she's sorry for him in all his ups and
      downs; but, as you say, no good could come of their being together so
      much, at least, and it is better to have it end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The postman left a letter for you-all this morning, didn't he?&rdquo; was a
      question Mrs. Chumley had evidently been holding in reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there wasn't anything. Dora went out to the fence to see if he had
      any mail, but he didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh, that's strange!&rdquo; Mrs. Chumley's purposely averted glance came back
      to the wrinkled face of her neighbor, and remained fixed there in a direct
      and probing stare. &ldquo;That's queer, for I certainly saw him hand her a
      letter over the fence as plain as I see that tub of suds. I saw her
      reading it, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be mistaken.&rdquo; Mrs. Barry's face had changed. There were
      splotches of pallor in her gaunt cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I couldn't be. I don't make mistakes in things of that sort&mdash;not
      of <i>that</i> sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Barry was silent. She was forced to admit that if any pair of earthly
      eyes could detect a hidden thing those eyes were now eagerly blinking
      under the sinister brows before her. As she stared into the reddish,
      freckled face, certain long-subdued fears rose within her. She felt faint,
      and had a sensation as if all visible objects were whirling around her.
      Then she became anchored by something in the gossip's glance which, had
      she has been less afraid, she would have taken as direct insult. It was as
      if the washerwoman were saying: &ldquo;Well, you know I can sympathize with you.
      I have been through it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She came back in the house after the postman had gone on,&rdquo; Mrs. Barry
      faltered, &ldquo;and told me there wasn't any letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor woman felt that her defence, if defence it might be called, was
      falling on wilfully closed ears, and again she was conscious of that
      rocking, floating sensation. The round, red visage of the washerwoman
      seemed to recede from her; there was a sound as of roaring water in her
      ears. But through it all the insistent voice of her tormentor beat into
      her consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she didn't show it to you, she <i>hid</i> it; I'm dead sure of that.
      She <i>hid</i> it. I have been watching your girl, Mrs. Barry, for several
      weeks, and I'm free to say that something has gone wrong with her. A body
      can see it in the drooping way she has in moving about. The day you sent
      her over for the salt I thought, on my soul, she'd drop in her tracks
      before she left the kitchen. Maybe the letter was to tell her where the
      scamp was going, or&mdash;or&mdash;well, there could be lots a fellow like
      that might say at such a time. But I'll be bound, he was putting her off.
      They all do. It is man-nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure she didn't <i>get</i> any letter,&rdquo; Mrs. Barry said, and she now
      tore herself away, conscious of her overwhelming disadvantage in the
      adroit woman's hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you'll find out I'm right,&rdquo; was the shot which struck her in the
      back as she turned the corner of the cottage. &ldquo;If you don't believe me,
      you can ask the postman; there he is&mdash;coming down the street right
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Barry did not pause. She went into the house and closed her door.
      She stood in the middle of the room like a creature deprived of animation.
      Through the parted curtains of an open window she heard the washerwoman
      call out to the man in uniform:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just had a bet up with Mrs. Barry, Sim Carter! She must think I'm
      blind. I told her you left a letter at her house this morning, and she
      says she never saw hair nor hide of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is there all right,&rdquo; the man laughed. &ldquo;I gave it to Miss Dora.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I told her. I say, Sim Carter, have they heard anything more
      yet about&mdash;&rdquo; But the postman was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the window, by stooping and peering forth, Mrs. Barry could see
      him crossing the street to the next house. With a heart as heavy as lead
      she went into the parlor; Dora was not there. She passed on to the
      kitchen; no one was there, either. There was something incongruous in the
      contented aspect of the fat, gray cat lying and purring in the sunlight on
      the door-sill. Bliss like that under the coat of a mere dumb brute when
      she had this to bear&mdash;this lurking, insinuating, maddening thing,
      which had been creeping slowly upon her night and day until it had assumed
      the shape and size of a monster of mental and spiritual torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went on to Dora's room, where she found the girl seated on her bed.
      The great, long-lashed, somnolent eyes, over the exquisite beauty of which
      men and women had marvelled, were red as from weeping. She gave her
      mother, as the old woman stood in the doorway, a weary, despondent glance,
      and then, half startled, looked down. Mrs. Barry saw the charred remains
      of a sheet of writing-paper in the open fireplace, and a fresh pang darted
      through her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you need me, mother?&rdquo; Dora inquired, softly, in the musical voice so
      many had admired, and which to-day sounded sweeter, more appealing, than
      ever before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Chumley says you got a letter from the postman this morning,&rdquo; Mrs.
      Barry said, tremblingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl seemed to hesitate just an instant; then she nodded, mutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was it from, daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, I don't want to say&mdash;even to you. I have reasons why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was from Fred Walton! You need not deny it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dora made no protest; she simply dropped her eyes to her lap, and sat
      motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew he had left, didn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother. I knew he was gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And while the whole town is wondering why he went, you know, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't feel that I have the right to talk about it, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I sha'n't urge you!&rdquo; And the older woman shambled away, now bearing
      doubts which were heavier and more maddening than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something's wrong&mdash;very, very wrong&mdash;or she wouldn't droop like
      that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh, God have mercy, I'm actually afraid to question my
      own child! I am afraid to even do that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sun went down, the night came on; workingmen, women, and children
      passed along on their homeward way from the cotton and woolen mills,
      carrying their dinner-pails. The very cheerfulness of their faces,
      lightness of step, and merry jesting with one another sent shafts of
      misery to the heart of the brooding woman. When she had put the supper on
      the table she went to the daughter's room and told her it was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of your art pupils came to the gate just now, didn't they?&rdquo; she
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the girl answered. &ldquo;Sally and Mary Hill wanted to know if I'd go
      sketching with them to the swamp to-morrow afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told them I'd let them know in the morning.&rdquo; Dora was at her place at
      the side of the table, and she felt her mother's despondent gaze turned on
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told them you'd let them know! Why, don't you know already? I thought
      you liked to go out that way. Some of your best studies were made at the
      swamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was feeling so badly,&rdquo; the girl sighed, &ldquo;that I didn't have the heart
      to promise. I can never work to any advantage if I am not in the mood for
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! <i>that</i> is it!&rdquo; They both sat down. &ldquo;You ought to fight against
      languor at this time of the year. I never let an ache or pain keep me from
      work. Sometimes merely being busy seems to help one. Your father used to
      stick at his easel as long as the light would hold out. He used to say the
      time would come when the whole world would admire your painting, and you
      really <i>are</i> improving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dora sighed, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Barry passed her a cup of coffee. &ldquo;Here, drink this down while it is
      hot,&rdquo; she advised. &ldquo;I made it strong. It will do you good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, mother, you are very kind to me.&rdquo; Dora drank some of the
      coffee, and daintily munched a piece of buttered toast. In the afternoon
      light, which fell through a western window, Mrs. Barry saw a deeply
      troubled look on the wan face&mdash;a certain nervous twitching of the
      tapering fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Dora pushed back her chair and rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care for anything else,&rdquo; she said, avoiding her mother's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you haven't eaten anything at all,&rdquo; Mrs. Barry protested, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't eat&mdash;I simply can't,&rdquo; Dora said, with strange and desperate
      frankness. &ldquo;I'm too miserable. Oh, mother, mother, pity me! pity me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Barry sat motionless, her head, with its scant hair, now supported by
      her two sinewy hands. She saw her daughter turn away, and, with dragging
      feet, go on to her bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God, have mercy!&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;She's as good as admitted it. What else
      could she have meant? Oh, God, what else&mdash;what else? She must know
      what I am afraid of. Oh, my baby!&mdash;my poor, poor baby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose from her untasted meal and followed her child, not noticing, in
      the gathering dusk, that Mrs. Chumley had entered the outer door, and was
      treading softly and with bated breath in her wake. She found the girl
      standing at a window, dumb and pale, looking out into the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must tell me everything, daughter,&rdquo; Mrs. Barry said. &ldquo;I can't sleep
      to-night unless you do. I am afraid I am going mad. Tell me, tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mother, mother, how can I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are ruined!&rdquo; Mrs. Barry groaned. &ldquo;Tell me I am right&mdash;you are
      ruined!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a cry, Dora turned and threw herself on the bed, and with her face
      hidden in a pillow she burst into dry sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make her tell you the whole thing,&rdquo; Mrs. Chumley spoke up, as she stood
      in the doorway. &ldquo;Have it out of her, and be done with it; that's the
      course I took.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Barry turned upon her, but no anger or resentment over the intrusion
      stirred the dregs of her despair. A faint shock came to her with the
      thought that now all Stafford would know the truth, but it was followed by
      the realization that, after all, concealment would not lessen in any
      degree the horror of the disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come away!&rdquo; she heard herself imploring the gossip. &ldquo;Let her alone! I
      won't have folks bothering her. She's got enough to bear as it is, without
      having people prying. Come away, come away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Chumley suffered herself to be led to the outer door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I came over to return the cup of sugar you lent me; I left it
      in the kitchen. I am much obliged, and I'm as sorry for you as one woman
      could be for another. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Barry went to the supper-table, and, as it was growing dark, she
      lighted a lamp. She proceeded to wash and dry and put away the dishes. No
      one would have suspected that such a deadening blow had been dealt her to
      have looked in on her at this moment, as she moved dumbly about the room,
      her head and face hidden by the gingham sunbonnet she had put on. It was a
      badge of humility&mdash;a thing she vaguely fancied hid her maternal shame
      from eyes which she already felt prying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her task finished, she stood for a moment hesitatingly; then she blew out
      the lamp and crept softly to the door of her daughter's room. Bending her
      head, she listened at the keyhole. No sound came to her ears, and she
      softly lifted the latch and went in. Dora still lay on the bed, her arms
      clutching the pillow, her face out of view in the darkened room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling, I haven't come to scold you, don't think that,&rdquo; the old woman
      said, most tenderly, as she sat down on the edge of the bed and took her
      daughter's tear-damp hand. &ldquo;This calamity has fallen on both of us, just
      as the death of your dear father did so far away from home, and just as
      many other hard things have come to us. I shall stand by you through it
      all. It is not the first time a poor young girl has been misled. Nothing
      is left for us but to do our duty to the best of our ability in the sight
      of Heaven. I shall not press you to tell me a thing, either. My knowing
      particulars wouldn't better matters at all. It is done, and that is
      enough. Now, go to sleep, baby girl, and don't give way to despair.
      Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dora sat up, extended her arms, and for a moment the two remained locked
      in a tight, sobbing embrace. Neither spoke after that. Tenderly releasing
      her daughter's twining arms, Mrs. Barry went out and softly closed the
      door. In her own room, in utter darkness, she undressed. Before retiring,
      and with the sunbonnet still on her head, she knelt beside a chair in the
      room and started to pray, but somehow the needed words failed to come.
      Prayer is born in hope in some sort of faith, at least, but this lone
      widow, brave as her front appeared, had neither.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Edwin!&rdquo; she suddenly cried out, &ldquo;she was your idol, your little pet;
      you used to say, as she sat on your knee in the firelight at night, that
      she was born to be lucky and happy. You said her beauty, genius, and
      gentleness would draw the world to her feet. You hoped all that for her,
      Edwin, and yet there she is bowed down in the greatest shame and sorrow
      that can fall to a young girl's lot. On the day you left never to return,
      you told me of the great Virginia family from which she was descended, and
      said that some day we'd be grandparents of children that would make us
      proud. Poor, dear Edwin!&mdash;that was only one of your pretty dreams&mdash;<i>our</i>
      grandchild, if God lets it come, won't even have a name of its own, and
      may bear this curse through a long life to its grave. Oh, Edwin!&mdash;my
      gentle, loving husband&mdash;you are here by my side to-night, aren't you?
      You are here putting your dear spirit arms about me, trying to comfort me,
      and you will help her, too, dear husband, as you are helping me. Hold up
      the sweet, stricken child. Fill her dark life with your own unrealized
      dreams. Give her something&mdash;<i>anything</i> to help her bear her
      burden! That's my prayer to you, Edwin&mdash;to you, and to God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went to her bed and threw herself down. Tears welled up in her, but
      she forced them back, and, dry-eyed and still, she lay with her wrinkled
      face near to the wall.

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>NE evening, two
      days later, General Sylvester and his niece and nephew sat on the front
      veranda to catch the cool breezes which swept across the town and stirred
      the foliage of the trees on the lawn. The old gentleman had been urging
      Margaret to go to the piano in the big parlor and sing for them, but she
      had persistently declined. Since Fred Walton's leaving, despite her
      evident efforts to appear unconcerned, she had not seemed to her watchful
      brother and uncle to be at all like herself, and they were constantly
      trying to divert her mind from the unpleasant matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture Kenneth Galt's carriage and pair of spirited blacks,
      driven by John Dilk, his faithful negro coachman, came briskly down the
      street, and turned into the adjoining grounds through the gateway to the
      gravelled drive, and drew up at the steps of the house, which was not very
      different from the Dearing home in size, period, and architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I forgot to tell you!&rdquo; the General exclaimed, suddenly. &ldquo;Galt is off
      to Atlanta, to see some more capitalists on our new railroad scheme. You
      may think lightly of it, my boy, but as sure as fate we are going to put
      that big trunk-line through&mdash;or, rather, Galt is. He thinks it is in
      good shape, and that is encouragement enough for me. He has handled my
      affairs ever since he hung out his shingle as a lawyer, and as he made
      money hand over hand for himself, he has for me too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he has the keenest sense of values of any man in the State,&rdquo; Wynn
      agreed. &ldquo;He has the full confidence of his clients, and he is not afraid
      to back up his ideas with money; that is what makes a successful
      speculator. He will put the road through if any one can. Investors will
      listen to a man who has succeeded in everything he has attempted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carriage was now leaving the house, and when it had regained the
      street and was about to pass, the General stood up and waved his
      handkerchief. The carriage paused at the gate, and the man under
      discussion sprang out, hat in hand, and hurried up the walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only a minute to get to the 8.40 train,&rdquo; he informed them, as he
      bowed to Margaret, and smiled cordially at Dearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth Galt was an interesting man from many points of view. His intimate
      friends liked him because, to them, he sometimes unbent and was himself;
      to strangers and mere acquaintances he was cold, formal, and almost
      painfully dignified. To his many clients he was seldom cordial or free,
      and never familiar. He had gleaned the idea somewhere, from his or some
      one else's experience, that no genuinely successful financier ever allowed
      himself to be taken lightly, so he never jested about his affairs nor
      encouraged it in others. He had set a high price upon himself and his
      chances of success in life, and he held to it the more tenaciously the
      higher he climbed. When approached for legal or financial advice his face
      was as immovable as granite, and when he gave an opinion it always had
      weight, for he was apt to be right. He was considered a man of wonderful
      ability and power among men. He couldn't have been a successful
      politician, for he could never have sufficiently lowered himself to the
      level of the common people, so it was fortunate for him that his ambition
      associated him with another and a more lucrative class. He was interesting
      as any human enigma could be which showed outward signs of hidden depth
      and strength. For an orthodox community like that of old Stafford, his
      iconoclastic views on some sacred subjects shocked many conservative
      individuals, but he was so firm in his philosophy and frank in his open
      expression of it, that he was forgiven where a weaker, less-important man
      would have been adversely criticized. He had convinced himself, or been
      convinced during the hours he had spent in his unique library, that there
      is no such thing as a soul or a soul's immortality, and he was proving, by
      his persistent effort to make the most of the present, that in the very
      renunciation of the dogma he had discovered the highest law of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are off, I see,&rdquo; the General said, &ldquo;and I hope the parties will
      not only be there, but with their check-books wide open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'll see what can be done,&rdquo; Galt answered, somewhat coldly, for it
      was against his policy to speak of business matters in any social group.
      &ldquo;I happened to have the land deed you wanted in my pocket, General, and I
      thought I'd stop and hand it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, thank you,&rdquo; Sylvester said. &ldquo;I knew it was all right, but I want
      to keep all my papers which you don't have need for in my safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is Miss Margaret?&rdquo; Galt now asked, as he turned the document over
      to its owner, and bent toward the wistful face of the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm quite well, thank you,&rdquo; she responded, forcing a smile. &ldquo;You are
      a fortunate man, Mr. Galt. My uncle doesn't praise many people, but he
      can't say enough in your favor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's because he only knows the <i>business</i> side of me,&rdquo; Galt said,
      ceasing to smile, and drawing himself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I must be off. I see John lashing the air with his whip; he is my
      time-table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you'd better not lose your train,&rdquo; the General put in. &ldquo;I don't want
      to be the cause of your missing that appointment. Get a rosebud for his
      buttonhole, Madge. It may bring us good luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will.&rdquo; The girl rose languidly. &ldquo;There are some pretty ones near
      the gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galt gallantly assisted her down the steps, and, side by side, they moved
      along the wide brick walk. Dearing heard his uncle chuckling as the old
      man peered through the twilight at the couple, who now stood facing each
      other over a bush of choice roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mark my words, my boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we may have to wait awhile for it, but
      as sure as you and I are alive, that pair will some day be more closely
      related to each other than they are now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dearing shrugged his shoulders and remained silent. &ldquo;You don't think so?&rdquo;
       the General pursued, with the eagerness of a child who has discovered a
      new toy. &ldquo;They can't help it. He is much older than she is, but it would
      be an ideal match. The fellow is actually a great man. There is no curbing
      his ambition. He has accomplished wonders so far, and there is no telling
      what his particular genius will ripen into.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be as you say&mdash;<i>in time</i>,&rdquo; Dearing answered, after a
      pause; &ldquo;but I'm afraid it will be years before Madge forgets Fred Walton,
      and if he should take a notion to come back, as such fellows always do,
      sooner or later, why, we'd only have our trouble over again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he told you he was going, never to come back?&rdquo; the old man said, with
      a touch of resentment even at the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he said positively that his conduct, whatever it was, would keep him
      from ever showing his face in Stafford again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been wondering what he could have done,&rdquo; General Sylvester said,
      musingly. &ldquo;I dropped in on his father the other day for no other reason
      than that he might let out some hint of the situation, but he never said a
      word. A big change has certainly come over him. His face was haggard and
      almost bloodless, and his eyes had a queer, shifting look. I am sure he
      knows all about the affair, whatever it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Fred said the old man knew, and would tell it, but it seems he has
      not,&rdquo; Dearing answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ashamed to let it be known, I guess,&rdquo; Sylvester said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret and Galt had parted, the carriage was disappearing down the
      street, and the girl was slowly strolling back. At a bed of flowers about
      ten yards from them she paused and stood looking down. Just then a loud,
      strident voice reached them from the side of the house. It was from Mrs.
      Chumley, who had brought the General's laundry home, and with her great
      empty basket was making her way across the grass toward the front gate,
      accompanied by old Diana, the colored cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I know it <i>is</i> true&mdash;every word of it!&rdquo; The white woman
      had raised her voice exultantly. &ldquo;I was right there at the girl's elbow,
      and heard Mrs. Barry accuse her of it. Dora admitted her ruin, and laid it
      to Fred Walton. Now, I reckon folks will know why he had to skip out by
      the light o' the moon without a bit of baggage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instantly the two men were on their feet, Margaret's protection foremost
      in their minds. There was no doubt that she had heard, for she was
      standing facing the two women like a figure carved from stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Miss Margaret, I didn't know you was there,&rdquo; Mrs. Chumley
      said, as she walked on; &ldquo;but it is the truth&mdash;the Lord knows it is
      the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, the brutality of it!&rdquo; the old man ejaculated. &ldquo;To think it should
      come to her like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scoundrel!&rdquo; Dearing cried. &ldquo;Now I understand fully, and if I had
      known the truth, I'd have&mdash;&rdquo; But he went no further, for Margaret was
      slowly coming toward them. The grass she trod was wet with dew, and
      ordinarily she would have realized it, and lifted her skirt, but she now
      moved toward them like a somnambulist. At the bottom step her foot caught,
      and as they both sprang to her assistance she gave a forced, harsh laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How awkward I&mdash;I am!&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;I could never da&mdash;dance
      the minuet with you now, Uncle Tom. I gave Mr. Galt a pretty bud. He is <i>such</i>
      a flatterer&mdash;saying that I&mdash;saying that he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly pressed her hand to her head and reeled helplessly. The
      strong arm of her brother went round her, and her head sank upon his
      shoulder. His face was wrung and dark with blended fury and anxiety, his
      strong lip was quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she is not fainting!&rdquo; He spoke to his uncle, but for her ears, with
      the intention of rousing her. &ldquo;She is all right. Wake up, Madge! I'll slap
      your jaws, old girl, if you play 'possum with me. You may fool <i>some</i>
      folks, but not your family doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not fainting. Who said I was?&rdquo; and Margaret raised her head, and
      drew herself quite erect. &ldquo;I&mdash;I am going in to sing for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was moving toward the door when her brother, with a catch in his voice
      and a firm step after her, said: &ldquo;No, not to-night, dear. Uncle Tom
      wouldn't listen, anyway. He's simply daft about the new railroad, and
      couldn't hold his tongue even for a minute. Look at those damp shoes. You
      will catch pneumonia. Run up to your room and change them at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>did</i> get them wet, didn't I?&rdquo; the girl said, glancing down at her
      feet. The next moment they heard her ascending the stairs. Her brother
      stood at the door peering after her till she was out of sight; then he
      went back to his chair, and sank into it. The General was eager to take up
      the startling topic, now that they were alone, but Dearing's ears were
      closed to what he was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; the young doctor said to himself. &ldquo;To think that it should
      come to her&mdash;to beautiful, gentle Dora, with her wonderful ideals! <i>And
      he could deliberately desert her!</i> He could look another man in the
      face and confess that he was without the courage to lift a woman up after
      he had knocked her down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving his uncle, he went up to his room and sat alone in the darkness
      before an open window. Across the lawn he saw a solitary light in Mrs.
      Barry's cottage. It was from the window of Dora's room, and for an hour he
      sat watching it. He kept his eyes on it till it went out; then he rose,
      and began to undress.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> FEW days after
      the report of Dora Barry's fall had permeated Stafford from the town's
      centre to its scattering outskirts, and the beautiful girl's disgrace had
      been duly recorded as the now certain explanation of Fred Walton's flight,
      it came to his father's ears in a rather indirect manner. Old Simon was
      erroneously supposed to have learned the truth, even before it became
      town-talk; for it was vaguely whispered that the banker had been so moved
      by Mrs. Barry's personal appeal to him in behalf of her daughter that he
      had called in the sheriff with the intention of having his son held to
      honor by sheer force, but for some reason had refrained from taking
      action.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are individuals in every community, too, who are bold enough to
      mention a delicate topic even to those most sensitively concerned, and as
      old Walton was going to the bank on the morning in question Bailey
      Thornton, a man of great size, who kept a grocery where the banker bought
      his supplies, essayed a jest as he passed the old man's morning cigar to
      him over the showcase. The bystanders thoroughly understood what was
      meant, as was evinced by the hearty laugh which went round, but the old
      man didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be hard on the boy, Mr. Walton,&rdquo; Thornton added, and he smiled
      broadly enough to explain any ordinary innuendo. &ldquo;Remember your own young
      days. I'll bet Fred came by it honestly. The whole town knows the truth;
      there is no good in trying to hide it. Tell him it is all right, and make
      him come back home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Simon grunted and walked on, flushing under the irritating chorus of
      laughter which followed him out of the store. &ldquo;Come by it honestly!&rdquo; he
      repeated. &ldquo;What could the meddling fool mean? <i>The whole town knows the
      truth!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fell to quivering, and almost came to a dead halt in the street. Surely
      the circumstance of the bank's loss was not leaking out, after all his
      caution? He decided that he would at once sound Toby Lassiter. Perhaps
      Fred had confided in others. The bare chance of the shortage being known
      and used against him by the rival bank alarmed him. In fancy he saw the
      report growing and spreading through the town and country till an army of
      half-crazed depositors, egged on by his enemies, was clamoring at the
      door, and demanding funds which had been put out on collateral security,
      and could not be drawn in at a moment's notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was passing along the corridor by the counting-room, where, beyond
      the green wire grating, the bookkeepers were at work, he caught Lassiter's
      glance, and with a wild glare in his eyes he nodded peremptorily toward
      the rear. He had just hung up his old slouch hat and seated himself in his
      chair when the clerk joined him, a look of wonder in his mild eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Toby, sit down&mdash;no, shut the door!&rdquo; Simon ordered; and when the
      clerk had obeyed and taken a chair near the desk, the banker leaned toward
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know,&rdquo; he panted, &ldquo;if the report is out about Fred's shortage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, Mr. Walton,&rdquo; the clerk said, astonished in his turn; &ldquo;that is,
      not to my knowledge. I haven't heard a word that would indicate such a
      thing. In fact, they all seem so busy with&mdash;&rdquo; But Lassiter colored
      deeply, and suddenly checked himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>something</i> is in the wind, I know,&rdquo; Simon went on, his lip
      quivering. &ldquo;It may be that Thornton only had reference to the boy's
      general extravagance, or he may have heard false reports about my own
      bringing-up; but I am not sure, Toby, but that the thing we are trying to
      hide is out.&rdquo; Thereupon old Simon, his anxious eyes fixed on the face of
      his clerk, recounted in detail all that the grocer had said, and exactly
      how it had come up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see!&rdquo; Lassiter exclaimed, in a tone of relief. &ldquo;He didn't refer to
      <i>the money</i>, Mr. Walton. He meant&mdash;&rdquo; It was loyalty to his
      absent friend which again checked the conscientious Toby, who was trying
      to reconcile two adverse duties, and now sat twirling his thumbs in
      visible embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see what?&rdquo; old Simon demanded, fiercely. &ldquo;Don't you begin shifting
      here and there, and keeping things from me. I want to know what's took
      place, and I <i>will!</i> You and I have always got on harmoniously, but I
      don't like your shillyshallying whenever that boy's name is mentioned. The
      other day, when I sent for the sheriff&mdash;well, you happened to be
      right in stopping me <i>that time</i>, I'll admit, but I want to know what
      you think Bailey Thornton meant by what he said. Do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk looked down. His face was quite grave and rigid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Walton,&rdquo; he faltered, &ldquo;I don't like to carry tales about matters
      which don't concern me, and when a nasty report gets in the air I try to
      keep from having anything to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm talking to you about <i>business</i> now!&rdquo; Old Simon raised his voice
      to a shrill cry, which, had it not stranded in his throat, would have
      reached the adjoining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The report touches on my affairs here in this house, and if you don't
      tell me, if you don't aid me with whatever knowledge you may have run
      across, you can draw your pay and quit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lassiter saw the utter futility of remaining silent longer, and with a
      desperate look on his face he answered: &ldquo;I didn't want to make the poor
      boy's case any worse, Mr. Walton, and so I hoped it would turn out untrue
      before it got to you; but they say the girl admits the whole thing. The
      minister of the church where she plays the organ told me it was true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Girl? What girl?&rdquo; the banker gasped. &ldquo;Why do you take all day to get at a
      thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as Lassiter told the story which was on every tongue, old Simon
      stared, his mouth falling open and his unlighted cigar seesawing between
      his jagged stumps of teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are plumb sure it wasn't the money that Thornton was talking
      about!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a deep breath of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am sure of that, Mr. Walton. They have been so full of chatter
      about the girl that not a word has been said about money, although some
      think you actually furnished the ready cash for him to get away on.&rdquo; The
      two sat silent for several minutes; then, shaking his tousled head and
      shrugging his gaunt shoulders in his faded black alpaca coat, the banker
      said, with grim finality of tone: &ldquo;He's a bad egg, Toby. That fellow is
      rotten to the core. This last discovery really helps us hide the other
      matter, but the two of them put together will wipe his name off the slate
      of this town forever. He'll never dare to show his face here again. He
      might have tried to get around me and live down the shortage, but I reckon
      both things coming to a head at once kind o' broke his courage, and he
      decided to skedaddle. I have no pity for the girl neither&mdash;not a
      smidgin; a woman that would give in to a scamp like him don't deserve any
      man's pity. Say, Toby, I'm a peculiar in some ways: as long as I felt that
      I owed something to that boy as his father his doings kind o' lay on my
      mind, but he has plumb cancelled that obligation. I can get along without
      worry over him if he is put clean out of my calculations, so after this I
      don't want no human being to mention his name to me. I'll let 'em know
      that they can't joke with me about it on the street. I want you to go this
      minute to Bailey Thornton's store and ask him for my account up to date.
      Then I'll send him my check, and do my trading with Pete Longley. He will
      be trotting in to apologize, but keep him away from me. Huh! he can't
      sneer at me as I walk along the public highways of this town; his account
      with us isn't worth ten cents a month, and he's shaky, anyway. I wish I'd
      hit him in the mouth as he stood there gloating over his dirty joke!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">K</span>ENNETH GALT came
      back from Atlanta at the end of the week. John Dilk drove down, and
      brought him up from the station at dusk. Galt had just alighted at his
      front steps, and the carriage had gone round the house toward the stables
      in the rear, when he saw Margaret Dearing among the flowers on the lawn
      adjoining. Through an open window, in the glow of gas-light, he could see
      the supper-table waiting for him, and knew that his housekeeper, Mrs.
      Wilson, had all in readiness for his evening meal. He knew, too, that she
      was most particular about having his favorite dishes served while they
      were hot, and yet he could not resist the temptation to exchange greetings
      with this fair young girl whose genial friendship and interest in his
      affairs had always appealed to him. The prospects were very bright for
      success in his plan of building a railway from Stafford to the sea, and he
      was still young enough to want to warm himself in the smile of the girl's
      approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are back!&rdquo; she said, cordially, as he strode across the grass,
      and lightly vaulted over the row of boxwood which divided the two
      properties. &ldquo;Uncle Tom will be delighted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I am very tired,&rdquo; he answered. He paused and shook her hand,
      experiencing a decided shock as he noticed the unexpected pallor of her
      face and the dark splotches beneath her eyes. &ldquo;I was on my feet all
      morning in Atlanta. I made a speech to-day at a luncheon, and then had to
      ride up on a slow train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the railroad is almost a certainty?&rdquo; she asked, forcing a wan smile.
      &ldquo;You are about to have your dream realized?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost,&rdquo; he answered, modestly. &ldquo;I think we may count on most of the
      subscribers for the stock throughout the South, and the farmers who have
      agreed to donate the right of way through their lands still seem
      enthusiastic. The only thing we lack is the support of a certain group of
      New York capitalists who are to put up the bulk of the funds and are now
      considering our final proposition. If they should go in the road would be
      a certainty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My uncle is sure they can be counted on,&rdquo; the girl went on,
      sympathetically. &ldquo;He declares no one but you could have won the confidence
      of all those prim, old-fashioned ladies and pious elders, who have never
      been willing to invest their savings before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galt shrugged his shoulders and drew back somewhat into his habitual
      mantle of reserve. &ldquo;If we <i>do</i> put it through,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they won't
      regret it. Thorough confidence in an enterprise like this is necessary, of
      course, and I am glad they trust me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All Stafford was reading the articles in the Atlanta papers yesterday
      about it,&rdquo; Margaret said. &ldquo;Uncle says when it is settled beyond a doubt
      the town will give a torch-light procession in your honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were many inaccuracies in the papers,&rdquo; he informed her, as he stood
      wondering over her evident dejection. &ldquo;Did you read the articles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I? Twice&mdash;once for myself and again for Uncle. I am sure he had
      already been over them, but, like the child he is, he wanted to hear the
      glorious news coming from the lips of some one else. I didn't like the
      pictures of you, though&mdash;not a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't? Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they don't do you justice; they were so harsh and fierce. They
      made your mouth look&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;cruel?&mdash;yes, cruel
      and utterly heartless. And we all know you are not so. Wynn says you have
      the greatest fondness for children of any man he knows, and surely that is
      a sign of a good heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one thing I am <i>now</i> showing an extravagant fondness for,&rdquo;
       Galt said, with a cynical laugh, &ldquo;and that is, hearing you sound praises
      that aren't deserved. So I am going to tear myself away from them and run
      in to supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor girl!&rdquo; he mused, as he walked away. &ldquo;She looks pale and troubled,
      and talks as if she were trying to hide something. She has altered, even
      in the last week. I wonder if she really cared for Fred Walton? Who knows?
      Women often like unworthy men. God knows, I ought to understand that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After supper Galt went up to his sumptuous quarters on the floor above,
      and, lighting a cigar, he threw himself into an easy-chair and began to
      smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I must see her to-night,&rdquo; he said, almost aloud. &ldquo;I can't wait
      longer. It has been more than a month now, and not a line from her. I am
      winning the fight of my life, and I want to see her glorious face light up
      as I tell her about it. She is the sweetest, dearest girl in the world.
      Her great dreamy eyes haunt me night and day. I love her, God knows I do.
      But it mustn't get out yet&mdash;not yet; not, at least, till my road is
      built. We have a right to our secret, the sweetest that ever a love-mad
      pair held between them. She trusts me, and for the present no one need
      dream of our intimacy. The last time I saw her the little darling had all
      sorts of fears in her dear little head, but such fancies are only natural.
      I'll kiss them away, once she is nestling in my arms. The dear little
      thing is jealous&mdash;actually jealous&mdash;of my success. She said once
      that she believed I would desert her if it would serve my ambition to do
      so. She doesn't know me. She has a wonderful brain, but she reads me
      wrongly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hours went by. The old grandfather clock in the hall below struck nine
      and then ten, and he rose and slipped down the stairs into the grounds
      below. Stafford was a town which went early to bed as a rule, and Galt
      found a vast stillness all about him out under the mystically shimmering
      stars. Softly treading the grass and furtively looking about, he went down
      to a gate near his stables, passed through and closed it without sound.
      Again looking up the little street cautiously, he went on till he reached
      the rear gate of Mrs. Barry's cottage. Going in, he walked through the
      widow's vegetable garden till he stood behind the little coal-and-wood
      house not ten feet from the open window of Dora's room. Here he paused,
      holding his breath in suspense. There was a light in the room as from a
      low-burning gas-jet at the bureau in the corner, and against the white
      window-curtain he saw the shadow of some one bowed over a table. The
      outlines of the silhouette were familiar, and they, set his heart to
      beating rapidly. Picking up some small particles of coal, he shot them at
      the window from his closed hand with the nail of his thumb. Sometimes they
      would fall short of the mark, but now and then one would strike the glass
      and produce a faint clicking sound. The trick was successful, as it had
      been before. The crouching shadow straightened up, the distinct profile of
      Dora's face appeared for an instant, and then lost its exquisite outlines
      in a blur of black which elongated itself upward as the girl rose to her
      feet. The curtain was drawn, and Dora, fully dressed, peered out. Stepping
      into open view, Galt signalled with his hand for her to come out. He saw
      her shake her head excitedly and stand motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      He signalled again and again, showing his impatience by the growing
      rapidity of his gestures and the impassioned movement of his mute lips. He
      heard her sigh, and then she nodded resignedly and retreated into the
      room. Her light went out. She was coming; he knew she would join him if
      her mother was asleep. And yet that sigh! What could it mean from her who
      had always come so joyfully, so full of love and faith? Ah, he had it! The
      gentle girl, not having seen him for several weeks, was genuinely jealous
      of the weighty affairs which had recently absorbed so much of his
      attention. All the uproar over his prospective success in the papers, the
      graphic accounts of his high position, had made her fancy, in her artistic
      sensitiveness, that circumstances were separating them. Ah, yes, that was
      it! But he would set her right on that score, as he always had done. He
      would convince her that their sweet secret was their own, and assure her
      that it need not be long now before they could announce their love to the
      world. Where could he look for a better or a truer mate? The secret of
      their present, and perhaps imprudent, intimacy would never be known. But
      for the time being, of course, he could not think of marrying <i>any one</i>.
      Much depended, right now, on his remaining exactly as he was&mdash;the
      suave bachelor whom certain prim and accurate maiden ladies had intrusted
      with the management of their finances, and reserved a right to decide, as
      members of some churches do in the cases of their unmarried pastors, what
      manner of woman their paragon was to choose, if any, as his partner in
      life. They would be unanimous in their verdict against the artist's
      beautiful daughter, not being able to see her worth and charm as he could
      see them. And to announce at the present crisis that he had chosen such a
      wife would certainly be inadvisable. He had become their idol, and his
      judgment told him he must retain their good-will in all things&mdash;at
      least, till he was independent of their support.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a low, creaking sound from the rusty hinges of the rear door of
      the cottage, followed by profound stillness, and he knew she had paused on
      the steps to see if her mother would wake. Then he breathed in vast
      relief, for he saw her coming. She had thrown a light shawl over her head,
      and as she passed from under the intervening arbor of grape-vines and the
      moonlight fell upon her partly exposed face, he was struck by its pallor,
      and by the desperate gleam in the eyes so steadily fixed on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, I see you at last, darling!&rdquo; he exclaimed, passionately, as he
      held out his arms. But to his amazement she drew back, warding off his
      embrace with a hand that was firm, strong, and cold as ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must go&mdash;you must never come again!&rdquo; she said, in a voice filled
      with suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little wood-house was between them and the cottage, and some tall
      trees bordering the little street threw a shadow over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, darling, what's the matter?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What has changed you so
      remarkably? Why, little girl&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean, you haven't&mdash;haven't <i>heard?</i>&rdquo; She clutched the
      shawl under her marble-like chin and stared at him, her pretty lips parted
      and quivering piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard what?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I have heard nothing&mdash;certainly no <i>bad</i>
      news. I've been away for a week, and only came home this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lowered her head, and stood silent and motionless. He put his hand on
      her shoulder and gently shook her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he urged, groping for an explanation of her agitation, &ldquo;is your
      mother ill again? Is she worse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn't that&mdash;God knows even that would be a blessing. Kenneth,
      I'm ruined!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean?&mdash;you <i>can't</i> mean?&mdash;&rdquo; He stood aghast
      before her, quivering now from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is no doubt of it. Mother suspected it, and was so miserable
      that I had to admit the truth. It almost drove her crazy. She was talking
      to me about it when that meddlesome woman, Mrs. Chumley, came in and
      overheard it. She lost no time in spreading the report broadcast over
      town. Everybody has known it for several days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; Galt pronounced the words in his throat. This thing, of all
      unexpected things, had burst upon him at the very crisis of his triumph,
      and it would ruin him&mdash;there was no denying that; it would ruin him!
      In his fancy he saw his hitherto irreproachable character torn to shreds
      by the men and women who, till now, had stood behind him. The dream of his
      life might be carried out some day, but not by a man of his stamp. He
      groaned aloud. For the moment it was impossible for him to show sympathy
      where sympathy most belonged. He stood as a man stands who loves life, and
      yet has been condemned to death. Love and the capacity for self-sacrifice
      in Kenneth Galt were best nourished by hope and happiness, and of these
      things he was now bereft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; his quivering lips finally produced, &ldquo;we must make the best of it.
      We've only done what millions before us have done for love of each other.
      And what do they say of me? I suppose they think I won't act the part of
      an honorable man; but, Dora darling&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say of <i>you?</i>&rdquo; she broke in, bitterly. &ldquo;They have never mentioned
      your name. Not a soul&mdash;<i>not even my mother</i>&mdash;dreams that I
      ever met you in secret. You are the last human being on earth that would
      be&mdash;be accused. Oh, you are safe! And I'd die ten thousand lingering
      deaths rather than drag you into it! Oh no, you are absolutely safe. I
      know full well what such an exposure would mean to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sense of unaccountable lightness possessed him; a vague sort of relief
      seemed to hover over him; the blood packed in his heart by horror now
      began to flow warm and free. &ldquo;They haven't mentioned&mdash;you say&mdash;You&mdash;didn't
      tell your mother&mdash;that I&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'd cut out my tongue rather than let her know. You told me when we
      last met that even a bare report of our engage&mdash;our love for each
      other right now would harm your plans. Do you think that I'd let a horror
      like this come up against you? Even if you declared it was true, I'd say
      it was a lie! I'd say I cared for some one else. They declare it was Fred
      Walton, anyway, because he left so suddenly. I've told them it wasn't&mdash;told
      them and told them, but they won't believe me. They may think what they
      please, but they sha'n't say it was <i>you!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fred Walton!&rdquo; Galt's mind galloped on. &ldquo;They blamed it on that reckless,
      devil-may-care fellow, and it would be like Dora's magnanimity to deny the
      truth for all time. But should he let her?&rdquo; A storm of incongruous
      tenderness now swept over him as he stood in the coign of immunity she had
      preserved for him and regarded the sweet, stricken creature before him. He
      laughed aloud in sheer derision of the escape she was offering him, and
      for one blind instant he actually believed in his own manhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave you?&rdquo; he said, warmly, and he took her hands into his, and,
      although she firmly resisted, he drew her into his arms and tenderly
      kissed her cold, flower-like lips. &ldquo;Let another man, and a scamp like Fred
      Walton, have his name coupled in that way with yours? Never! I want you,
      Dora. I'd be a miserable dog, even if I succeeded with my paltry
      enterprise by leaving you! No, I'll come here to-morrow and we'll be
      married, as we ought to have been months and months ago. Now, go to bed,
      and let me see roses on your pretty cheeks in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are speaking without thought&mdash;without knowledge of yourself.&rdquo;
       The girl sighed as she drew away from his embrace and forcibly put down
      his detaining hands. &ldquo;You see, I know you, Kenneth, better than you know
      yourself. You love me in a way, I am sure; but when it was all over, and
      you'd paid the debt you think you owe me, you'd blame me for being the
      blight to your prospects that I would be. Listen! What is done is done.
      Because I am disgraced is no reason you should be. You are a man whose
      ambition is his life. Married to me, and hampered by the name I now bear,
      you'd not only fail in your present enterprise, but you would be held down
      to the end of life. Oh, I know you so well&mdash;so very well! The praise
      and adulation of the prominent men and women whose friendship you have are
      the very life-blood of your being. I've known you had this weakness for a
      long time, but I had to bear with it as a natural shortcoming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How absurdly you talk!&rdquo; he cried out, in dull, crushed admiration for
      such logic in one so young and frail. &ldquo;But I assure you, Dora, I'll not
      listen to such silly stuff for a minute. You are going to be my wife. Do
      you hear me?&mdash;my wife! We will let the blamed railroad go. I'll tell
      General Sylvester in the morning that we are off for our honeymoon. Of
      course he'll drop me like a hot potato, but he may do it for all I care.
      You are more to me, darling, than he and all the trunk-lines in the world.
      Yes, I am coming for you to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow afternoon at three
      o'clock! Remember that&mdash;at three, sharp, and I'll&mdash;I'll bring a&mdash;a
      preacher and&mdash;everything necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll do nothing of the sort,&rdquo; Dora said, firmly. &ldquo;You think at this
      moment that you have the courage to do what you propose, but, Kenneth, you
      <i>haven't</i>&mdash;you simply haven't! I know you better than you know
      yourself. You will not come to-morrow <i>nor any other day!</i> I'll never
      see you again, nor do I want to. I had a kind of love for you that only a
      woman could understand; you have had quite another sort for me. You think
      yours is still alive, but it died of paltry fear, stifled by avarice; mine
      was a girlish dream. I am awake now. Leave me, and don't approach me
      again. I swear to you that your secret is safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved away. He tried to stop her; but, with a warning finger on her
      lips, she eluded his grasp, and hurried into the house.

      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>RAVE, very brave,
      and sweet and noble!&rdquo; he said to himself, as he walked back toward the
      gate of his grounds; &ldquo;but she certainly sha'n't have her way. I'm not low
      enough for that, thank God! She is the only creature I ever loved or could
      love, and she is mine by all the laws of heaven and earth. She looked like
      a young goddess as she stood there with that fire in her suffering face,
      and calmly consigned herself to disgrace and oblivion that my sordid
      schemes might prosper. I am not poor. I can make a living somehow,
      somewhere, if not in this sleepy old town; and with her always by my side,
      why&mdash;&rdquo; Across the lawn he saw a light in a window of the Dearing
      house. It was in General Sylvester's room. The old gentleman retired
      earlier than this as a rule, and Galt told himself that his being up now
      was due to the almost child-like joy over the encouraging condition of
      their joint enterprise. He saw the old soldier's shadow as it flitted
      across the window, and knew that he was walking about, as was his habit
      under stress of excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old man!&rdquo; Galt, now in his own grounds, leaned against the wall of a
      rustic summer-house. A thought had struck him like a blow from the dark.
      What would Sylvester say when he was told the truth? Galt saw the look of
      sheer, helpless incredulity on the high-bred, war-scarred face as the
      revelation was made, and watched it glow and flame into that of anger,
      contempt, and bitter disappointment. The mere confession of wrong-doing he
      might accept as frankly as it was offered, but that the young man should
      allow such a mishap to drag his own proud name into the mire and wreck the
      greatest enterprise that had ever blessed a down-trodden community&mdash;well,
      he couldn't have believed such a thing possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heavily laden now with the fires of a purer passion burning low under the
      shadow of his impending ruin, Kenneth Galt dragged himself slowly along
      the walk toward his house. He was turning the corner to enter at the front
      when he saw a carriage and pair at the gate. The moon had gone under a
      thin cloud and the view was vague, but surely they were his own horses,
      and the man on the driver's seat certainly looked like John Dilk.
      Wonderingly, Galt went down to the gate. The negro was fast asleep; his
      massive head had fallen forward, and the hands which held the reins were
      inert. The gate rattled as Galt touched the iron latch, and the man woke
      and looked about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is dat you, Marse Kenneth?&rdquo; he asked, sleepily. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Galt answered,
      rather sharply. &ldquo;What are you doing with the horses out at this time of
      night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! oh! Le' me see, suh!&rdquo; The negro's wits were evidently scattered. &ldquo;I
      sw'ar I dunno, Marse Kenneth. Bless my soul, you jump on me so sudden dat
      I can't, ter save my life, tell you&mdash;Oh yes, now I know, suh! Why,
      ain't you seed de Gineral since you got home, Marse Kenneth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no. Does he want me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yasser, yasser, he sho' do,&rdquo; the negro answered, now thoroughly himself.
      &ldquo;He been searchin' fer you high and low, Marse Kenneth. He went all thoo
      yo' house. He got some'n 'portant ter tell you. He ordered me ter hurry
      an' get out de team, an' have it raidy fer you'n him. He just run in his
      house er minute ago. Dar he is comin' now. He's dat excited an' worried
      about not findin' you he can't hardly hold in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      General Sylvester, as he stepped from the veranda, recognized Galt, and
      hurried toward him, pulling out his watch and looking at it in the
      doubtful light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;we haven't a minute to lose. You've only got
      twenty minutes to catch the 11.10 North-bound train! Run up and get your
      bag! I saw it there, still unpacked, and you needn't waste a minute. I've
      glorious, glorious news from New York&mdash;a wire from Alberts, Wise
      &amp; Co. They have got the right men for our deal, and with dead loads of
      money. They are ripe for the thing, and the brokers wire that if you can
      be there day after to-morrow morning you can close it. They say if you are
      not there then that the money may be diverted to other deals, and they
      advise all possible haste. So hurry. You must not miss the train.
      Everything depends on it. Run, get the bag! John, <i>you</i> get it!
      Quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'll&mdash;I'll do it!&rdquo; Galt gasped. &ldquo;Wait, I'll be down in&mdash;in
      a minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then hurry. We can talk on the way to the station. My boy, we are simply
      going to land it! The blessings of the widows and orphans, whose property
      is going to bound up in value, will be on your plucky young head. Hurry
      up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galt moved away, as weak in action as a machine run by a spring of such
      delicacy that it could be broken by the breath of an insect or the fall of
      an atom. It struck him as ridiculous that he should be going for his bag
      if he did not intend to use it; and to confess even now that he couldn't
      make the trip would seem queer and cowardly, for he ought to have
      explained at once. Ascending the stairs, he reached his room. He turned up
      the gas, and his image in the big pier-glass between the two end windows
      looked like that of a dead man energized by electricity. There lay the bag
      by the bed, the black letters &ldquo;K. G.,&rdquo; on the end, blandly staring at him.
      Galt looked at it, and then back to his reflection in the mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he cried out, suddenly, &ldquo;if I go to-night I'll be deserting her
      forever, and she will have read me rightly! She would keep the secret; no
      human power could wrench it from her. She would keep it; and I&mdash;I,
      who have led her to her ruin, would be deserting her as only a coward
      could! I am beneath contempt. And yet what am I to do? I am what I am&mdash;what
      the damnable forces within me and my ancestors have made me. Napoleon
      loved, and put aside and cast down for his ambition, and have I not the
      same right for mine? I am not an emperor, but my ambition, such as it is,
      is as sweet to me as his was to him. As she says&mdash;as the gentle
      wilting flower says&mdash;I'd be miserable, <i>even with her</i>, under
      the wreckage of all these hopes. She knows me; child though she is, she is
      my superior in many things. She knows that the loss of this thing&mdash;now
      that I've tasted the maddening cup of success, now that the poison of fame
      and public approval is rioting in my blood&mdash;would damn me forever!
      Accidents of this sort have ruined <i>weak</i> men. <i>Strong</i> men have
      lived to smile back upon such happenings as the inevitable consequence of
      the meeting of flame and powder, and have gone to their graves without
      remorse. I've known such men. I've heard them say that no matter how
      heavily nature may scourge the conscience of man for theft, for murder,
      for any other misdeed, it yet deals lightly with this particular offence.
      And why? Because there can be no charge of deliberation in an act to which
      passionate youth is led by the very sunshine and music of heaven. And yet
      I'll lose her. Great God, <i>I'll actually lose her!</i> I can never look
      into her sweet face again, or kiss the dear lips ever whispering their
      vows of undying faith until hell opened her eyes to&mdash;to my frailty.
      No, no, I can't desert her; I can't&mdash;I simply can't! I <i>want</i>
      her! I <i>want</i> her. With all my soul, I <i>want</i> her!&rdquo; There was a
      step in the hall below, and General Sylvester's excited old voice rose and
      rang querulously through the still space below:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of Heaven, what's the matter?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Come on! You may
      miss the train as it is! <i>Come on!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One second, General!&rdquo; Galt cried out. &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; He had not yet decided, he
      told himself, and yet his cold hand had clutched the handle of his bag. He
      lifted it up, swung it by his side, and, stepping out into the corridor,
      peered over the balustrade down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can't wait, man!&rdquo; the General shouted from the walk outside. &ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I'm ready!&rdquo; and Galt strode rapidly down the stairs, sliding
      his hand on the walnut railing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what is the matter with you?&rdquo; Sylvester peered at him anxiously in
      the moonlight as he emerged from the doorway. &ldquo;You look white and worried.
      You've done too much in Atlanta, with all those receptions and banquets.
      Let's call a halt on the social end of the business till we have clinched
      the thing good and tight. Put this New York deal through, and we can dance
      and sing and cut the pigeon-wing as much as we please. But you will pull
      it through, my boy, my prince of promoters, with that wonderful say-little
      air you have. You are the man to make that crowd of Yankees think we are
      granting <i>them</i> favors instead of <i>asking</i> for them. If you
      don't miss connection and get there on time, you will win as sure as you
      are a foot high.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General was pushing him into the carriage, and John Dilk, with whip
      poised in the air, and a tight, wide-awake grip on the reins showed
      readiness for his best speed record.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, John,&rdquo; Sylvester cried, &ldquo;miss that train, and I'll break every bone
      in your black hide!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The negro laughed good-naturedly. It was exactly the sort of command he
      loved to get from the old man who had done him a hundred services.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You watch me, Marse Gineral,&rdquo; he said, with a chuckle; &ldquo;but you better
      keep yo' mouf closed. Ef you don't, dis hoss in de lead will fill it wid
      clay. He's de beatenes' animal ter fling mud I ever driv.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On they sped, cutting the warm, still air into a sharp, steady current
      against them. The General babbled on enthusiastically, but Galt failed to
      catch half he was saying. To all outward appearances, he was being hurtled
      on to triumph; in reality, he was leaving the just-filled grave of his
      manhood. Before his humiliated sight stood a wonderful face written full
      of knowledge of himself&mdash;a knowledge more penetrating than that of
      the world-wise men who bowed before his prowess; a face, the beauty and
      tenderness of which were ever to remain stamped on his memory; a face
      wrung by a storm of agony, contempt, and&mdash;martyrdom! And he was
      striking it! The pleading eyes, scornful nose, quivering, drooping mouth
      were receiving the brunt of all his physical force! He knew the cost, and
      was going to abide by it. A believer in the eternal existence of the human
      soul might have paused, but Galt had always contended that nothing lay
      beyond a man's short material life. And that being his view, how could he
      suffer material glories like these to slip through his fingers for the
      sake of a mere principle&mdash;a transient dream of the senses? Yes, yes;
      and yet the pain, the crushing agony, the maddened thing within him which
      all but tempted him to clutch the chattering old tempter at his side by
      the neck and hurl him to the earth!
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet he nodded and said he was glad that the General had been so
      thoughtful as to telephone the station-agent to secure the drawing-room on
      the Pullman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must not do things by halves,&rdquo; the old soldier crowed. &ldquo;The man who is
      to have his own private car as the president of the great S. R. and M.
      must not be seen, even by a negro porter, crawling into an upper berth.
      Your plan of living high in order to be on a high level is fine business
      policy. You haven't spared expense in Atlanta; you mustn't in New York,
      either. Dine 'em, wine 'em; throw wads of cash at the servants&mdash;do
      anything! They know who the Gaits of Charleston and Savannah were before
      the War: let 'em see that the old blood is still alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had been at the station only a minute when the train arrived. John
      Dilk brushed by the porter at the step of the long sleeper, and proudly
      bore his master's bag into the drawing-room. There was a hurried shaking
      of hands between Galt and the General, and the train smoothly rolled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone in the luxurious compartment, Galt sank down. The obsequious porter
      stood awaiting orders, but the passenger scarcely saw him or heard what he
      was saying. Galt was now fairly stupefied by the magnitude of his crime.
      It flashed upon him as actually an incredible thing&mdash;his leaving Dora
      with so much to bear!
    </p>
    <p>
      He had taught her that their love, like that of their favorite English
      novelist, had lifted them above mere conventional rules and ceremonies,
      and rendered them a law unto themselves. But the awakening had come. She
      had seen him in the garish light with which Truth had pierced his outer
      crust and revealed his quaking, cringing soul. She would despise him, the
      very murmuring of the ponderous wheels beneath him told him that, and from
      now on he must avoid her. To offer her financial aid in her coming trial
      would only be adding insult to injury, knowing her as he knew her; so even
      that must be omitted&mdash;even that, while he was accepting the price of
      her misery.

      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE morning sun
      beat fiercely down on Fred Walton and his new friend as they trudged along
      the dusty road. The pangs of hunger had seized them, and no way seemed
      open to obtain food short of begging it at one of the farmhouses which
      they were passing, and that Fred shrank from doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could have stopped in Atlanta long enough to have sold my watch we
      could have paid our way for awhile,&rdquo; he told his companion, &ldquo;but I thought
      we ought to be on the move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; the younger agreed, with a slow, doubtful look into the
      other's face. &ldquo;Will you tell me&mdash;I give you my word you can trust
      me,&rdquo; he went on&mdash;&ldquo;if you have any reason, except for my sake, in
      getting away from the city?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have, Dick,&rdquo; Walton replied. &ldquo;I may as well admit it. I am in a
      pretty tight place. Things are done by telegraph these days, and I don't
      feel entirely safe, even here in the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I'm sorry, Fred!&rdquo; the boy declared. &ldquo;You have been so good to me that
      it doesn't look right for anybody to be running you down like a common&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thief!&rdquo; Walton supplied the word in a tone of bitterness. &ldquo;That's exactly
      what some would call it. But you mustn't be afraid of me, Dick. I went
      wrong, and lost a good home and many friends by it. I've lost something
      else, too, Dick&mdash;<i>some one</i> else whom I once had as my own, but
      who is now out of my life forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;you mean&mdash;a sweetheart?&rdquo; ventured the boy, as he put
      out a sympathetic hand and touched the arm of his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walton nodded. He had averted his eyes, that his companion might not see
      the tears which blurred his sight, but no word escaped his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry,&rdquo; Dick Warren said, simply, and his hand tenderly clung to the
      dust-coated sleeve&mdash;&ldquo;I'm sorry, Fred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you knew her, Dick,&rdquo; Walton went on, reminiscently. &ldquo;If you did, I
      reckon you'd pity your pal. Here I am, a tramp, an outcast in dirty
      clothing, and no money in my pocket. If you'd ever seen her, you'd never
      dream that such a girl could have actually cared for a man like me. I've
      got her photograph in my pocket. It is in an envelope. I have not looked
      at it once since I left her. I may never again on earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo; the boy asked, wonderingly. &ldquo;It seems like it would be company
      for you, now that you and she are&mdash;parted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She gave it to me in trust and confidence,&rdquo; Walton answered, his dull
      gaze still averted. &ldquo;She wouldn't want me to have it now. I shall keep it&mdash;I
      simply can't give it up; but I shall not insult her purity by looking at
      it. I must harden myself, and forget&mdash;forget thousands of things. You
      may see it if you wish.&rdquo; Walton drew the envelope from his pocket and
      extended it to his companion. &ldquo;I'll walk ahead, and when you've looked at
      it put it back in the envelope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; thank you, Fred.&rdquo; The boy fell back a few steps, and with his
      eyes straight in front of him Walton trudged on stolidly. The boy gazed at
      the picture steadily for several minutes, and then caught up with his
      companion and returned the envelope. He was silent for a moment then he
      said, with a slight huskiness in his young voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like for me to say anything about her, Fred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think I should,&rdquo; Walton responded, slowly, as he thrust the
      envelope back into his pocket. &ldquo;Yes, Dick, I'd like to hear what you think
      of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is so sweet and gentle looking&mdash;so good&mdash;so very, very
      pretty! Oh, Fred, I understand now how you feel! I don't think I ever saw
      a face that I liked better. It may be because she is your&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Was!</i>&rdquo; Walton broke in. &ldquo;Don't forget that, Dick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think a girl like that, with a <i>face</i> like that, would forgive
      almost anything in the man she loved,&rdquo; the boy went on, in a valiant
      effort at consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she still loved him, perhaps; but she could no longer love him,&rdquo;
       Walton sighed. &ldquo;She belongs to a proud family, Dick, not one member of
      which was ever guilty of such conduct as mine. She would shudder at the
      sight of me, she would blush with shame for having cared for me. That's
      why I came away. If I had not loved her, I'd have stayed and faced my
      punishment.&rdquo; After this talk the two trudged on through the garish
      sunshine without exchanging a word for several miles. It was noon. They
      had come to the gate of a farmhouse which bore the look of prosperity, and
      they paused in the shade of a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can't go farther without eating,&rdquo; the boy said. &ldquo;You don't like to
      beg, but I don't care; I've done it hundreds of times, and don't feel
      ashamed of it. I'm going to put on a bold front and tackle the kitchen in
      the rear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't ask for anything <i>for me</i>,&rdquo; Walton said. &ldquo;I'm not very hungry.
      I can get along for some time yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till I find out how it smells around that kitchen,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick laughed. &ldquo;I'm nearly dead.&rdquo; The boy had opened the gate, and was
      walking briskly toward the house, which stood back about a hundred yards
      from the road. Walton saw him meet a great lazy-looking dog near the steps
      and pat the animal on the head. Then the dog and boy went round the
      building toward the kitchen. A moment later Walton saw Dick returning, a
      flush on his face and empty handed. The dog paused near the front steps,
      wagging a cordial if not, indeed, a regretful tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dirty red-faced scamp ordered me to move on!&rdquo; Dick cried, angrily.
      &ldquo;He says the country is overrun with tramps, who won't work and who expect
      to live on the toil of honest men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say that?&rdquo; and Walton's eyes flashed. &ldquo;I'd like to prove to him
      that I'm no&mdash;But what's the use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, he's coming!&rdquo; the boy said, eagerly. &ldquo;Maybe he's changed his mind.
      A woman was listening to what he said. Perhaps she's told him to call us
      back.&rdquo; The fat, middle-aged farmer, bald, perspiring, and without hat or
      coat, strode down to them, and languidly opened the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, I just want to tell you fellows <i>one more thing</i>,&rdquo; he panted,
      as he wiped his bearded chin with his pudgy hand, &ldquo;and that is this: We
      may look like a lot of galoots just out of an asylum along this here road,
      but most of us have a grain of sense. Back here a piece a neighbor of mine
      sent two able-bodied men like you two about their business a month ago,
      and that night his barn was fired. Now, if you fellows try any game of
      that sort on me, I'll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dry up!&rdquo; Walton cried, as he suddenly faced him. &ldquo;I wasn't begging of
      you. I only let this boy go up to you because he is nearly starved. You
      can't insult me&mdash;I won't have it! I am not a tramp. As proof of it, I
      have a good solid gold watch here that I am willing to sell you or any one
      else at any fair price you may put on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! let me see it.&rdquo; The farmer's eyes gleamed avariciously as Walton
      took the watch from his pocket and extended it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man tested the weight of the timepiece by tossing it lightly in his
      palm, and then he pried the case open with the stiff nail of his thumb,
      and, with a critical eye, examined the works.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Full-jewelled and good make,&rdquo; he said; and then he gave it back. &ldquo;I'm a
      trader,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I make money buying and selling any old thing from a
      pickaxe to a piano, from a pet cat to a blooded horse; but I hain't in <i>your</i>
      market.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you 'hain't'?&rdquo; Dick Warren mocked him, in fresh anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I hain't,&rdquo; the obtuse farmer repeated. &ldquo;I did a fool thing like that
      when I was a boy. I bought a bay mare from a man who rid up to my daddy's
      barn without a saddle, blanket, or bridle&mdash;had just a heavy hemp rope
      round her neck. I bit, and chuckled all that day as I rid about, showing
      the gals how bright I'd been. Then the sheriff of the county hove in
      sight, and&mdash;well, my daddy had to pay out a hundred-dollar lawyer's
      fee to prove that I wasn't of age, never had had any sense, and couldn't
      have knowed the mare was stolen property. So, you see, when a fellow comes
      hiking along here without a nickel to buy a loaf of bread, and lookin'
      like he's been wading through swamps and sleeping in haystacks, and has a
      gold ticker that is good enough fer the vest-pocket of Jay Gould, why, I
      feel like pullin' down the left-hand corner of my right eye an' axin' him
      ef he hain't got a striped suit under his outside one, hot as the weather
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You blamed old&mdash;&rdquo; Dick Warren began, threateningly, as he bristled
      up to the farmer, his fists drawn; but Walton put out his hand and stopped
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's right, Dick,&rdquo; he said, and there was a pained look about his
      sensitive mouth. &ldquo;The circumstances are dead against us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I reckon they are, gents,&rdquo; grinned the man at the gate. &ldquo;Anyways, I
      don't think you will find a buyer fer that timepiece. Good-day. There
      ain't nothing in all this palaver fer <i>me</i>,&rdquo; and his eye twinkled as
      he finished. &ldquo;My wife's got dinner waitin' for me: a good fat hen, baked
      to a turn, with rich corn-meal stuffin', an' hot biscuits, coffee,
      string-beans, and fried ham&mdash;the country-cured sort that you've read
      about!&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> SWEAR, I'd enjoy
      firing <i>his</i> barn!&rdquo; Dick fumed, as the two friends walked on through
      the beating sun. &ldquo;I don't think I can stand much more of it, Fred. I'm all
      gone inside. The lining of my stomach has folded over.&rdquo; They were passing
      the corner of a field where, in the distance, they could see two men at
      work digging ditches to drain the boggy land, and they paused again to
      rest under the shade of a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess they will stop soon and go home to a square meal,&rdquo; Dick said,
      bitterly; and then his roving glance fixed itself on a spot in the corner
      of the snake-fence near by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; he exclaimed, exultantly, &ldquo;we are in luck! Gee, what a
      pick-up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, now?&rdquo; Walton asked. But the boy was bounding away toward the
      fence. &ldquo;You wait and see&mdash;gee, what luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walton stood and watched him as he climbed over the fence, dived into the
      thick underbrush, and reappeared with a covered tin pail in his hands. As
      he came back he unfastened the lid and laughed loud and long. &ldquo;Full to the
      brim!&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;Meat, bread, pie, and a bottle of fresh milk. We can
      leg it along the road a piece and sit down to it, or stow it away as we
      walk. My dinner-bell's rung, old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it back, Dick! Go put it back!&rdquo; Fred said, firmly, his eyes averted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy stared, a blended expression of surprise and keen disappointment
      capturing his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really mean it, Fred?&rdquo; he asked, his lip falling, the pail hanging
      motionless at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is not ours,&rdquo; the other said. &ldquo;Put it back before they see you,
      and then I'll&mdash;I'll try to explain what I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy swore under his breath, and for a moment he stood gloweringly
      sullen, but at the third command of his companion he retreated to the
      fence and dropped the pail into its place. Then he came back, his head
      hanging, his face still dark with disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he grunted, and started on without waiting to see if Fred was ready
      to go. Walton followed, and presently caught up with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not a preacher, Dick,&rdquo; he began, with a forced laugh, which was
      intended as an opening wedge to the boy's displeasure, &ldquo;I'm not one bit
      better than you are. I've stolen a farmer's watermelons by the light of
      the moon, and climbed his June apple-trees, and filled my pocket with his
      prize fruit, and heartily enjoyed it; but somehow I feel differently now.
      Dick. I'm older than you are, and reckless living has got me down and
      stamped all hope out of me. I'm fighting for my life. I'm swimming in a
      strange, swift stream, and my strength is almost gone, but I have grasped
      at a straw; it may hold me up, it may not; but I hope it will. That straw
      is the determination to live right&mdash;absolutely right&mdash;from now
      on, no matter what it costs. I've done great wrong, and I'm sick with the
      very thought of it. I want to try to do what is right, and if I could
      influence you to feel as I feel about these things, I'd like it mightily;
      it would strengthen me in my course. Two can succeed better, even at a
      thing like that, than one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'm <i>starving!</i>&rdquo; the boy whimpered. &ldquo;The world wasn't made for
      anybody to starve in. The birds up there in the trees don't starve, and
      God gave them as good right to live as you or me. Huh! when that beefy
      chump back there sows his wheat they watch him with their keen eyes from
      their nests in the trees, and when his hulking back is turned they chirp
      with glee and pounce down on his seed and take it and flutter away with it
      in the sunshine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick, you are a bloody anarchist!&rdquo; Walton laughed gently as he placed his
      hand affectionately on the boy's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know whether I am or not,&rdquo; Warren retorted, still ruffled. &ldquo;But
      the blamed bucket of grub may stay where it is. I wanted it for your sake
      as much as mine, but I sha'n't ask you to sit down to other men's dinner
      if you are going to ask the blessing over it. But you are too dang
      particular. At least, I've got as much right to the stuff as they have,
      for they can go home and get more, and I can't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is <i>one</i> way to look at it,&rdquo; Walton said, quietly, &ldquo;and I
      thought as you do once, but I don't now.&rdquo; After this they trudged along
      for several minutes in silence. The boy did not raise his eyes from the
      dusty ground, but he put his hand on Walton's arm, and there was a catch
      in his young throat as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fred, somehow you make me think of my mother, When she was alive she was
      always wanting me to be good. She used to talk to me when I was a little
      tiny fellow. It was always that one thing over and over: 'My little boy is
      not going to be a bad man when he grows up, is he?' That's what she said
      time after time, and in a thousand ways she tried to impress it on me. She
      worried a lot about me just before she died. You see, my father&mdash;well,
      he didn't care what became of me, or her, either. He drank like a fish,
      and went with idle men about the loafing-places&mdash;in fact, he was shot
      and killed in a bar-room. I've tried pretty hard to have faith in what my
      mother used to say about God's mercy and all that stuff, but, Fred, God
      never answered her prayers to look after <i>me</i>. If I haven't had to go
      it blind, I don't want a cent. Selling papers on the street at night till
      nearly morning, sometimes sleeping in a stairway, outhouse, or stable.
      Then I was a messenger boy, for a little better wages, in a dead boy's
      uniform, and finally became a tramp telegraph operator. But, Fred, you are
      true blue. I don't want a better pal. The way you yanked out that watch
      and offered it to keep me out of jail when it was the last thing you had
      in your pocket&mdash;well, you can count on me, that's all. I won't try to
      stuff another man's grub down your throat, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A man was coming toward them on horseback, and as he drew near he reined
      in and leaned forward on the neck of his horse. &ldquo;Gentleman,&rdquo; he began, as
      he pulled at his scraggy beard and kicked his feet more firmly into his
      wooden stirrups, &ldquo;I don't know whether you fellows are interested in the
      like or not, but I'm riding round here and yon trying to drum up hands to
      gather and crate and ship my crop of early peaches. There is such a demand
      for labor of that sort all through the peach section that we are powerful
      short on help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two pedestrians exchanged eager glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your place?&rdquo; Fred asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it's a few miles to the right, over them hills,&rdquo; the rider said.
      &ldquo;It's the Womack farm. That's my name. I've got a hundred acres of dandy
      Elbertas, and they are ripening as fast as chickens in a hatching-machine.
      They are a thing that has to be picked an' got off in cold-storage cars at
      exactly the right minute or they ain't worth the nails in the crates when
      they get to market. They say if all us early fellows can manage to hit New
      York just right this year, we'll get three dollars a crate, an' that will
      pay big, as times are now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far is it to your place?&rdquo; Walton asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it's a little better than seven mile&mdash;on a beeline; but I
      reckon by the nighest road it's a matter of ten or thereabouts. You
      fellers look a little mite tired, but by stiff walking you could get there
      by sundown. You can make good wages in a pinch like this if you will buck
      down to it&mdash;I calculate three plunks a day for each of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how long would the work last?&rdquo; inquired Fred, as he and Warren looked
      at each other, their pulses quickening, their eyes beginning to glow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I could hold you down for two weeks at least, for mine don't all
      ripen at once; but after you was through on my land you could go farther
      north and get more to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we'd better take you up,&rdquo; Warren said. &ldquo;I'd like that sort of
      work.&rdquo; He winked at his friend and rubbed his stomach. &ldquo;I see myself <i>packing</i>
      good, ripe, juicy peaches right now, but not in crates. The truth is,
      farmer, we are mighty hungry, and that is a long walk. Now, if you had
      fifty cents about you that you'd be willing to let go in an advance, why
      we'll buy a snack at some farm-house, and go right on to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horseman's shrewd face fell. He leaned forward and ran his gnarled
      fingers through the mane of his horse, and avoided the pair of anxious
      eyes fixed on his. &ldquo;I don't want to be blunt and hurt your feelings,
      fellers,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But we never come together before&mdash;we are plumb
      strangers, I might say; and, well, to tell the truth, last year I started
      out on this same business, and to my certain knowledge not a man, woman,
      gal, boy, nor baby that I advanced money to ever got to my place, while
      all the others who wasn't paid was there bright and early.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we are hungry and weak!&rdquo; Dick Warren protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, some o' them that I failed to get told the selfsame tale. One said
      if I'd pay off the mortgage on his land, he'd bring his entire family; but
      that wasn't <i>business</i>, and I refused. I'm making you fellows a fair
      open-and-shut proposition. You hit my place before dark to-night and tell
      my wife to give you a square meal&mdash;tell her I've hired you to pick
      and pack, and that I said to stow you away somewhere for the night. She
      will make room for you. Now, I hope I'll see you there. That's as good as
      I can offer, as I look at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, we'll be there,&rdquo; Walton promised. &ldquo;And we will do the best we
      can for your interests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, gentlemen, I'll expect to see you there when I get back. So
      long.&rdquo; And with his legs jogging the flanks of his mount, the farmer rode
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can make it, Dick,&rdquo; Walton said, encouragingly. &ldquo;Let's bend down to
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thought of that meal is enough to keep me going,&rdquo; the boy replied.
      &ldquo;What do you reckon she will give us? But stop! My mouth is watering at
      such a rate that I believe I'll try not to think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was long after sundown when the wayfarers reached the farm in question.
      The house was a rambling, one-story, frame structure which originally had
      been painted, afterward whitewashed, and rain and storm beaten till not a
      trace of any sort of coating remained on the bare, fuzzy, gray boards. At
      the gate, or bars, of the snake-fence, in front, they paused, faint and
      exhausted, wondering if they would be bitten by watch-dogs if they entered
      unannounced. On the grass under the trees in the front yard a group of
      twenty or more young women and young men were singing plantation melodies,
      and here and there couples were sitting alone or strolling about, their
      heads close together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are peach-gatherers,&rdquo; Walton surmised. &ldquo;Come on; there are no dogs
      that I can see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crawling through the bars, they went to the house. There was no light in
      the front part, but a yellow glow shone from a window against the dark
      foliage of the trees in the rear, and thither the wanderers directed their
      lagging steps. Looking in at the open door of the kitchen, they saw the
      portly form of the farmer's wife at a table washing dishes in the light of
      a smoking brass lamp which had no chimney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed, as her kindly eyes fell on them. &ldquo;Not more pickers,
      surely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what we are, and as good as you ever laid eyes on,&rdquo; Dick told her.
      &ldquo;Mr. Womack said you'd give us something to eat. We haven't had a bite
      since yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; The woman drew her hands from the big dish-pan and dried them on
      her apron as she looked them over doubtfully. &ldquo;Pete Womack goes crazy
      every year at picking-time. He's filled the house, barn, and yard with
      hooting and singing gals and boys, and furnished nobody to wait on 'em but
      me. The gals all say they are too fagged out at night to lay their hands
      to cooking or dish-washing, and yet, if you'll just listen and watch,
      you'll see that they are all able to gallivant with the men about the
      yard. Six couples met here for the first time last summer and got married.
      They say there's some progress being made right now between three or four,
      an' picking's just set in. I tell Pete he ought to start a marrying-agency
      and take out a license to preach, so he can tie 'em on the spot and
      collect two fees. Some of 'em are respectable and mean all right, but Pete
      is so anxious to get his crop off on time that he's got women in that
      bunch that&mdash;to <i>look</i> at 'em&mdash;Well, it ain't any of <i>my</i>
      business! I ain't set up as a judge, and as the saying is, I won't throw
      no stones. But you say you are hungry, and I don't see how I could give
      you a thing hot at this time of night. My fires are out, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hot!&rdquo; Dick shouted. &ldquo;Why, I've got such a big storage capacity that I'd
      be afraid to take it hot. It might generate steam and explode.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman laughed. &ldquo;Well, you <i>must</i> be hungry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come on
      in the dining-room and I'll lay it out in a minute. There is plenty of
      cold stuff. I cook a lot ahead. You have to feed pickers like kings or
      they won't stay. It won't take long to heat the coffee. But I reckon you
      want to wash and wipe. You'll find pans and water on the shelf in the
      entry, and a clean towel on the roller. I'll be ready when you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see about that, old lady,&rdquo; Dick challenged her, as he made a dash
      for the near-by water-shelf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two minutes later the two wanderers sat down at a long, improvised table,
      made of unplaned planks, in the dining-room. In the light of a guttering
      home-made tallow dip the farmer's wife spread before them the best meal
      that famished men ever feasted on. They saw roast chicken with dressing,
      fried chicken with cream gravy, country-smoked ham in a great platter of
      eggs; butter, hard and cold, from the spring-house; great, snow-capped
      pound-cakes, biscuits, apple-sauce, jellies, jams, cold buttermilk, and
      hot coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know where I'm going to bunk you boys,&rdquo; Mrs. Womack said, in a
      motherly tone, as she stood behind their chairs, and, with unsuppressed
      delight, watched them eat. &ldquo;The women and gals have got every bed in the
      house; and every spot on the floor, even to the kitchen, has been staked
      off by the men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter with the barn?&rdquo; Dick mumbled, with his mouth full. &ldquo;I
      wouldn't want a better place this time of year than a sweet-smelling bed
      of fresh hay or fodder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's plenty of room in the loft down there,&rdquo; the woman replied; &ldquo;but
      somehow I hate to see nice-looking young men like you put in a place like
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will do very well,&rdquo; Fred assured her. &ldquo;In fact, we would rather like
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, a little later, if you decide to stay, I may fix you a place in the
      house,&rdquo; the woman said; &ldquo;but you got in too late to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm dead tired and sleepy, Fred,&rdquo; Dick said, when they had left the
      table. &ldquo;Let's turn in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Directed by Mrs. Womack, they went down to the barn, and from the big
      cattle-room on the ground they climbed a ladder to the loft above. A
      startled hen flew from her nest with a loud cackling as they crawled
      through the hay and husks and leaves of corn to a square, shutterless
      door, through which the hay was loaded to wagons below. They threw off
      their coats and vests, and made pillows of them; then took off their
      shoes, and lay down and stretched out their tired limbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the doorway they saw the fathomless sky filled with mysterious
      stars. The chirping of some chickens, as they jostled one another on the
      roost below, came up to them; the champing of the teeth of a horse, as he
      gnawed his wooden trough; the snarling of a tree-frog; the far-off and
      dismal howling of a dog, and&mdash;they were asleep.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was not till
      early autumn that the two friends reached their far-off destination.
      Fred's watch had been sold; they had saved the greater part of their
      earnings from the various odd jobs at which they had worked, and had made
      of their journey by rail. It was Walton's idea that they must put their
      best foot to the front in Gate City, and start out with a good appearance
      in their new home, and so the most of their funds were promptly invested
      in new clothing. Notwithstanding their spick-and-span appearance, however,
      luck seemed against them, for every application they made for work&mdash;Dick
      as a telegraph operator and Fred as an accountant&mdash;was refused them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city was a bustling new place with prosperity and activity in its very
      air. There were great railway-shops, factories of several kinds, and
      various other enterprises. It was a typical Western &ldquo;boom&rdquo; town. Its
      buildings were modern, its streets regular and well-paved. Men and women,
      as they drove through the streets in their carriages, thought nothing of
      it if a mounted horde of yelling cow-boys galloped past with their
      revolvers playfully flourished, nor saw anything unusual in the gangs of
      blanket-draped Indians who hung about the bar-rooms, dance-halls, or
      gambling-houses. The new-comers liked the place; Dick believed they would
      eventually secure work, and Fred had the first sense of security which had
      come to him since leaving Stafford. Here, under his new name, in this
      remote place, he was sure he would meet with no familiar face, nor catch
      any discordant echoes of the life he had left behind him, and which he was
      trying to banish from his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was in the town a certain Stephen Whipple, a man about sixty-five
      years of age, who had come from one of the Southern States shortly after
      the Civil War. He had established himself, first, as a small grocer, but,
      having acquired considerable wealth, he was now the owner of the only
      wholesale grocery store in the place, an establishment which was known for
      miles around.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an earnest member of the Presbyterian church of the town, and its
      chief pride, owing to his influence in the community. It had been his
      money which had built the church to which he belonged, and it was said
      that he practically paid the salary of its eloquent young preacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his great red-brick, four-story business-house on the main street
      Stephen Whipple had his private office. It was in the rear of the
      counting-room and was of unusual size, and by many deemed a curious place.
      Indeed, it was put to strange, unbusiness-like uses, for it was here that
      the owner of the establishment personally received all sorts of
      applications for aid. There were half a dozen plain chairs in the bare,
      uncarpeted room, and the Rev. Luke Matthews, who had the entrée to the
      office at any moment, often found a motley gathering of supplicants on
      hand, each patiently awaiting his turn to be beckoned to the seat close to
      the portly, shaggy-browed merchant. There were individuals who called the
      old man a deep-dyed hypocrite, for they held that no really
      self-sacrificing toiler in the Lord's vineyard could have amassed the
      great wealth old Whipple was known to possess. But this was disputed by
      all the men in his employment, at least, for they were ready to attest
      that Whipple had often held over important business matters till the case
      of some suffering applicant could be investigated and relief supplied.
      There were other uses to which this room was put. Old Whipple, in order to
      render his pet church more attractive to the public, selected and paid out
      of his own pocket the salaries of the best choir in town. He was no expert
      musician, but he had them meet in his office and practise on every
      Saturday afternoon, and he was always present, seeing to it that
      refreshments were served and the singers made comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one morning when Dick Warren and Fred Walton had been in the town
      for a month, and had reached the lowest ebb of their resources, that the
      minister dropped in to see the merchant. The Rev. Luke Matthews was of
      unusual height, measuring six feet four, very slender in build, and of
      markedly nervous temperament. He was under thirty, unmarried, wore his
      black hair long enough to touch his shoulders, and had the thin-lipped,
      unbearded face of an Edwin Booth. It was said of him that he couldn't keep
      a coin in his pocket&mdash;that it was promptly given to the first beggar
      he met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, brother, how are your bones?&rdquo; was the halfjesting greeting he gave
      the old man, as he bustled in, buttoning and unbuttoning his long black
      coat and swinging his broad-brimmed hat at his side. &ldquo;Not holding court
      this morning?&rdquo; He laughed as he looked over the empty chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I sent the last prisoner up for life an hour ago,&rdquo; the merchant
      responded, jovially. &ldquo;Set down, set down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The long-legged man with the poetic face complied. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;you'll have to be a judge in that sort of tribunal so long as you inhabit
      this globe.&rdquo; He smiled, showing two fine rows of white teeth. &ldquo;It looks
      like the Lord is pushing you on to unlimited prosperity, and your work for
      humanity will increase instead of letting up. Say, brother, I know the
      sort of thing you glory in, and I've had an experience&mdash;the sort of
      experience that makes a fellow feel like preaching is worth while. It was
      exactly the kind of thing you are interested in yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you run across now?&rdquo; Whipple asked, as he leaned his elbow on
      his desk and rested his florid face on his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The genuine thing, brother&mdash;a genuine reformation in a young chap
      hardly out of his teens. He's been coming to my special meetings for young
      men, and, as I'm a close observer, I was attracted by his face. It
      interested me more than that of any boy's I ever saw. Finally, I ventured
      to approach him. I never scare them off if I can help it, but I singled
      him out from the rest last Thursday evening and spoke to him. I saw that
      he was greatly moved, and I invited him into my study, and we had a good
      long heart-to-heart talk. Brother Whipple, I never felt the glory of God
      bearing down on me in my life as I did while that boy was talking&mdash;while
      he was telling me his past history. Crying like his heart would break, he
      confessed to having been almost everything a boy could be&mdash;a thief, a
      tramp, and an all-round, good-for-nothing idler, from his childhood up to
      his sudden awakening to what was right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, good!&rdquo; Stephen Whipple ejaculated, his features working, his kind
      old eyes twinkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now comes the climax to my experience,&rdquo; the minister went on. &ldquo;You
      and I meet a converted person now and then, but we don't often run across
      individuals in private life who are leading lives which convert. The boy
      went on to tell me, brother, how he was rescued from arrest by a young man
      who was a tramp like himself. They began searching for work side by side.
      The boy told me how his new friend&mdash;without ever saying a word that
      was preachy&mdash;gradually won him from his ingrained tendencies and
      taught him the difference between right and wrong. He gave me scores of
      touching and inspiring incidents that had happened between them during
      their wanderings here and there, trying to get work. Somehow I became even
      more deeply interested in the fellow I hadn't met than the one I had in
      tow, and so I asked the boy if he would introduce me to his friend. He
      hesitated for a while, and then finally agreed to take me to the room they
      had together. It was away over beyond the railroads, in the slums of our
      'tenderloin' district. It seemed to be the only room whose price they
      could afford, and they were unwilling to contract for what they could not
      pay. It was an awful place, brother, up a narrow flight of shaky stairs,
      in the attic of a negro shoemaker's house, in the worst part of
      'Dive-town.' The man, this Fred Spencer, when we came in, was seated at
      the little dingy window reading a newspaper. He seemed very much
      surprised, and flushed red as he stood up and shook hands. He was
      fine-looking&mdash;strong and tall, well-clad and neat from his feet to
      his carefully combed hair, but his great big sad eyes haunted me long
      after I left him, and when he spoke his voice seemed to come from a proud
      spirit that was crushed and broken. He began by saying that his friend had
      spoken to him of my meetings, and that he was exceedingly grateful for my
      interest and courtesy in calling. He tried to apologize for the appearance
      of the room, and insisted on my taking the only chair while he and his
      room-mate sat on the bed, which, by the way, was unfit for a convict to
      sleep on. They used it together, and yet it was barely wide enough for
      one. The straw in the mattress was crumbling to powder and falling to the
      floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor chaps,&rdquo; the merchant sighed, &ldquo;and they have evidently seen better
      days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spencer, the older one, has decidedly,&rdquo; the minister answered. &ldquo;He is
      evidently Southern, for he has the soft accent of Virginia, I should say,
      and the manner of the old aristocracy. I told him that I had heard of his
      good influence over the boy, and he got redder than ever, and tried to
      make light of what he had done, endeavored, in fact, to convince me that
      the boy had only spoken as he had out of personal friendship. Finally I
      offered my assistance toward finding employment for them both, and Spencer
      showed real embarrassment&mdash;as if he did not want to put me to any
      trouble in the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's tried to find work here, then?&rdquo; Stephen Whipple mused, aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and been turned down on all sides. He has tried till he has lost
      hope. He likes Gate City, but is afraid they will be driven to the road
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to think that a fellow like <i>that</i> can't find work,&rdquo; Whipple
      cried, indignantly, &ldquo;when the world is full of grafters and panhandlers!
      Brother Matthews, I am interested in those fellows, especially the oldest
      one. My list is full, as you know, but I can manage to find places for the
      right sort. Couldn't you send him to me right away? I'll be here to-night
      after closing time. There won't be anybody else about, and me and him can
      talk undisturbed. I'd like to help a chap like that. You have got me
      interested. The world is too full of bad men who are prospering for his
      sort to go unrewarded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll send him, Brother Whipple. God bless you, old man, you can
      always be counted on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening the merchant sat in the light of his green-shaded gas-lamp at
      his desk waiting for the expected caller. The outer door of the great
      building, which opened on the main street, was ajar, and was plainly
      visible to the merchant from his seat. Now, as he heard his visitor
      coming, he rose to his feet, pushed his desk-chair back with his ponderous
      calves, and stood smiling cordially. As the young man entered, politely
      removing his hat, Whipple grasped Walton's hand and shook it warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm powerfully glad to know you, Mr. Spencer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am, indeed.
      I'm told you are a newcomer to our brag town, and as I'm one of the
      pioneers, so to speak, I take a personal pride in the place, and I want to
      see everybody that drifts this way anchored here for life. It certainly is
      the town for fresh young blood. Even old men can make money here, and I
      know the young can. Set down, set down! I'm glad you ran across my
      long-legged jumping-jack of a preacher. He is a wheel-horse, I am here to
      state. If all the churches in the world were led by men of his stamp,
      infidelity would die of the dry rot or burn up with shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I built Matthews' meeting-house, and if I hadn't found a man like him to
      fill the pulpit I'd have turned the blamed thing into a warehouse to store
      groceries in. But I found him, and he's doing mighty well&mdash;mighty
      well! He isn't any of your ranting trance religionists; he's practical,
      and, in one way, the funniest cuss you ever laid eyes on. Me and him have
      big times in our way. He looks after the souls of men while I sometimes
      help a little in patching up their bodies. He tells me that you and a
      friend of yours haven't made any business connection yet. My house is
      pretty well supplied, but this is our best season of the year, and a good
      man always comes in handy. You look like you've got a good head on them
      broad shoulders, and I want to give you a start, so if you will show up
      here in the morning with your friend, I'll put you to work in the office
      and stow him away somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very, very kind, Mr. Whipple,&rdquo; Fred said, a gratified flush on
      his face; &ldquo;but you have had no recommendation of me, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't <i>want</i> none,&rdquo; the merchant said, firmly. &ldquo;You see, I've
      already heard about you. Long before me and you met you had cast your
      bread on the water, and it has already come back. I've heard about you.
      Anybody these days can bring a scrap of paper with indorsements scribbled
      on it, but the best recommendation is the sort that crawls along ahead of
      a fellow. Yes, I've heard about you, and, to be plain, that's why I sent
      for you. Even if I didn't have no opening right now, it would pay me to
      rub against men that&mdash;well, that believe like you do and act like you
      have acted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you mean&rdquo;&mdash;Walton was quite embarrassed now&mdash;&ldquo;I
      suppose Mr. Matthews has been speaking of what my friend told him of our
      ups-and-downs together; but really I couldn't let that sort of thing stand
      as an indorsement of me, Mr. Whipple. Dick is young and enthusiastic. It
      seems that he has never had a close friend before, and he naturally
      exaggerates my&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, look here,&rdquo; the merchant broke in, with a smile, &ldquo;you really don't
      know how funny that sounds. In this day and time, when a man in my
      position has to set and listen to folks spout for the hour about how good
      and worthy they are, why&mdash;well, to see a chap actually denying the
      favorable things which have been said behind his back is a downright
      curiosity. Why, the very fact that you are <i>talking</i> this way shows
      plain enough what you are. Along with what I've picked up about you and
      the&mdash;the general look of you, now that you are at close range&mdash;why,
      if you was to lay down a whole batch of written recommendations I'd chuck
      'em in that stove. I'm a judge of human faces and of men, and I know you
      <i>mean</i> well, and that is all I ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very good of you, Mr. Whipple,&rdquo; Walton said, his glance on the
      floor. &ldquo;I feel like we could get on together. I know I'd do my best to
      please you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, there is nothing more to be said,&rdquo; old Whipple answered.
      &ldquo;Bring that boy in to-morrow morning, and we'll make some sort o' a
      start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fred sat silent. He took a deep breath and raised his eyes to the genial
      face in the green light. &ldquo;I must be frank and open with a man as generous
      as you are, Mr. Whipple. If I am to work here we ought to understand each
      other thoroughly. There are some things which you must know about me, or I
      cannot consent to enter your employment, for it would be deceiving you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>that's</i> it!&rdquo; Whipple said, awkwardly. &ldquo;Still, you mustn't feel
      that I am requiring any explanations of&mdash;of a private nature, for I
      am not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to know more than you do know about me, at all events,&rdquo; Walton
      went on. &ldquo;I'd feel better if nothing at all was hidden from your
      knowledge. I haven't lived right, Mr. Whipple. I went wrong&mdash;frightfully
      wrong. I got in debt&mdash;it is worse than that. I misappropriated a
      considerable sum of money belonging to my father. He is a stern, hard man,
      and demanded as much of me as he would have done of a stranger. I left
      home to escape arrest. You may think I ought to have submitted to the law.
      I simply couldn't, for I felt that my father, when his passion cooled,
      would regret his step, and, moreover, I felt that, with my freedom, I
      could apply myself and eventually restore the loss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merciful Father!&rdquo; Whipple exclaimed, fervently. &ldquo;Lord have mercy! To
      think of a man blessed with a son holding the law over his repentant head
      and chasing him from spot to spot over God's green earth! The child he
      brought into the world and saw cooing in the cradle, a little, tiny sprout
      of his own flesh and blood, made in the image of the Lord God of Hosts! My
      boy,&rdquo; the old man leaned forward, &ldquo;shake hands with me. I've often wanted
      to help young men in my stormy life, but, God knows, I never felt the
      desire as strong as I do now. Just in this little talk I've been drawn
      more closely to you than I ever was to a human being before. You are the
      right sort, the genuine thing; if I was to turn you adrift, I'd never get
      over it. I had a boy once, and I doted on him. He died when he was a
      little toddling fellow, and since then I have never been consoled. But his
      loss, and the memory of him, has warmed my heart to young men wherever I
      meet them. You must come to me, my boy. I feel sure we'll pull together.
      In fact, I'd want you at hand, for I'd grieve to see you falter in your
      noble undertaking. God will bless your effort as sure as the stars are
      shining up there in the heavens to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't told you quite all yet,&rdquo; Walton added, in a low tone. &ldquo;To
      protect myself, I took another name. My real name is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! Don't tell me. That won't make one bit of difference to me,&rdquo;
       Whipple answered, with a sigh, as if he were thinking more of the young
      man's former revelations than the one just made. &ldquo;No doubt it is best. You
      say you have determined to make good the loss, and if bearing another name
      will help you out, then it can't be wrong. Go ahead, I'll be your friend;
      I'll stick to you. I'm glad we came together to-night. It makes me feel
      better. I've seen many sorts of human struggles, but I never saw one that
      touched me down deep like yours does. Wait, let me lock up, and I'll walk
      along a piece with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Outside, after he had closed the heavy door, the merchant put his hand on
      the arm of his companion, and they moved on down the street together.
      Suddenly they paused. Whipple swept his fat hand in a slow gesture toward
      the skies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; he said, fervently, &ldquo;this is a wonderful, wonderful old world.
      Life seems hard and harsh at times, but when the soul is right a man can
      conquer anything. I have my fight to make; you have yours&mdash;stick to
      it, and may the Lord be with you! Goodnight.&rdquo;. .

      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>LD Stafford had
      changed wonderfully in the six years which passed after Fred Walton's
      flight. The building of President Galt's trunk-line to the sea had marked
      the turning-point in the town's career. The older portion of the place
      remained quite as it was, but new suburbs and new centres of commerce had
      sprung up beyond the old incorporated limits. Where farms, fields, and
      pastures had once been, now lay even, well-graded, and electric-lighted
      streets. No small city in the South had a better freight-rate to all
      points, and this had brought about the establishment of various
      manufacturing enterprises which had greatly increased the population. The
      clang and clatter of new growth was in the air; speculation in
      building-sites was rife. The modest price of one day was the jest of the
      next. Owning a great deal of the land along the new railway, General
      Sylvester was now more wealthy than ever, and the new interest in life had
      given him back his youth and health.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Kenneth Galt, he had scarcely spent a day in the town of his birth
      since his hurried journey to New York to meet the capitalists whose
      co-operation had made the road a certainty. His explanation to Sylvester
      was that other points on the long line constantly demanded his attention.
      His old home was still cared for by Mrs. Wilson as housekeeper and John
      Dilk as gardener, and now and then a false report had emanated from these
      proud and worshipful menials that the distinguished owner was coming back
      to reside there permanently. Indeed, he had promised General Sylvester to
      do so time after time, only to make more delays and more excuses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's coming this time sure,&rdquo; the old soldier said to his nephew on the
      veranda one day in the early part of the present summer. &ldquo;I had a letter
      from him this morning, in which he promised to come and spend the hot
      weather here and take a good long rest. Mrs. Wilson said, also, that he
      had written her about renovating his rooms, so I reckon it is settled. And
      when he comes you will see that I was right about my prophecy concerning
      him and Madge. He's a woman-hater, they say&mdash;won't have a thing to do
      with society; and, quiet and reserved as your sister is, the two will
      naturally drift together. I'll be glad to have him back. That shady old
      place, with its early associations, will fairly make him over. When I
      spent that week with him in Savannah I naturally expected to find him at
      the top of the social heap, but he went nowhere at all, and even seemed to
      shun the men who extended courtesies to him. He's had too big a load on
      him; his face shows wrinkles, and his hair is turning at the temples.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is a strange chap,&rdquo; Dearing answered. &ldquo;I have been thrown with
      him in Atlanta several times of late, and while he really seemed glad to
      see me, and was cordial enough, in a way, I couldn't exactly make him out.
      As usual, I found him moping over his favorite books, and every bit as
      anxious, as of old, to prove that the grave ends everything. That will
      ruin any man, Uncle Tom. When a fellow actually gets to fighting the
      belief that we are more than sticks and stones he can't rise very high in
      any spiritual sense. Why, Kenneth has even reached the point of defending
      some of the lowest things that men do. He and I were walking away out in
      the outskirts of the city one night. He had asked me to go, because he
      wanted to avoid some clubmen who were bent on having him preside at a
      banquet given by the Chamber of Commerce. We were all alone, and it was
      dark. He had asked me, I remember, if any news had come as to the
      whereabouts of Fred Walton, and I had told him that nothing at all had
      been heard except that his father had cut him off forever. To my
      astonishment, Kenneth actually sighed. Then I distinctly heard him
      muttering to himself: 'Poor fellow. Poor chap! He's been treated like a
      dog!&rdquo;' &ldquo;Huh, the idea!&rdquo; Sylvester broke in. &ldquo;Well, that's like Kenneth. He
      is always ready to take up for somebody or something that no one else
      believes in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, feeling as I did, and knowing what I do of the case,&rdquo; Dearing
      continued, warmly, &ldquo;I couldn't hold my tongue. I didn't leave a grain of
      sand for Fred Walton to stand on, and it made me hot for Galt not to agree
      with me. He made some weak remark about men obeying natural laws, and
      being cursed with uncontrollable passions, and the like; but I flatter
      myself that I silenced him. I gave him a picture of that beautiful girl's
      isolated life with her son and old mother, wholly ostracized in the only
      community they had ever known or loved. I saw, then, that I had touched
      his sympathies in another direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You think,' he said, 'that Walton ought, even <i>now</i>, to go back and
      marry her&mdash;<i>at this late date?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him that I had grave doubts as to whether a woman who had suffered
      as she had at a man's hands would ever want to see her betrayer again, and
      he answered that he felt sure she wouldn't. Then he asked about the boy.
      You know, he was always fond of children&mdash;that is one redeeming
      quality he has, and it makes me hope that he isn't so heartless as he
      would have us believe. He listened attentively to all I said about Lionel,
      even asking me questions as to how the child looked and how he amused
      himself. When I told him that the little fellow was completely cut off
      from other children, and that his association only with his mother and
      grandmother had made him act and speak more like an older person than a
      child, he seemed actually shocked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You don't mean to tell me,' he said, 'that the people of old Stafford
      would turn against a helpless child because of any fault or mistake of its
      parents!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I explained to him that it was mostly due to the pride of his mother, and
      to the natural fear that such an intelligent boy, and one so sensitive and
      observant as he is, might learn of his misfortune and suffer from it. That
      conversation raised Kenneth Galt in my estimation, Uncle Tom. I know now
      that he has true feeling and sympathy for the unfortunate, and that his
      ambition is not all there is to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must confess that the child has greatly interested me,&rdquo; the General
      said. &ldquo;From my window I can see him playing in that narrow yard, always
      dressed neatly, and as strong and straight as an Indian in his bearing. I
      have never seen him outside the fence. I have stopped to speak to him once
      or twice in passing, and have been actually charmed by his face and
      manner. I don't think I ever heard of a case exactly like his. Of course,
      there have been thousands of children born like that in straitlaced
      communities, but I never heard of one being brought up in that prison-like
      way. It surely is wrong, and it will make the truth all the harder to bear
      when it does come out, as it must sooner or later. She is a wonderful
      woman&mdash;I started to say girl, for she seems almost like a child to me
      with that sad, young face, and wistful, artistic beauty. I have met her
      mother on the street a few times, her old face thickly veiled, but I have
      not seen Dora or the child away from the cottage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As their family doctor,&rdquo; said Dearing, &ldquo;I urged Dora to go out herself
      for exercise and to take the boy with her. At first she flatly refused. I
      frightened her, however, by saying that the constant confinement would
      injure Lionel's health. Since then she has taken him with her in fine
      weather when she goes sketching in the woods and swamp back of the
      cottage, but she is as shy as a fawn about it. I venture to say that no
      one has ever met her on those excursions. I've seen mother-love, Uncle
      Tom, in all its phases. I've met it at the death-beds of scores of
      children, but the love between that unfortunate mother and child is the
      prettiest thing on earth. No pair of lovers were ever more constant and
      affectionate. Lionel is really a sort of psychological oddity in his way.
      I have a theory that the mother's morbid suffering was in some prenatal
      way stamped on her offspring.' He is queerly supersensitive for one so
      young, and seems constantly afraid that he won't be liked. He is rather
      fond of me&mdash;perhaps it is because I'm the only visitor at the house;
      and when I take him in my lap to hold him, I can see that he enjoys it as
      if it were an unusual luxury. He closes his eyes sometimes and smiles, and
      says he wants to go to sleep that way. Then he will ask me over and over
      again if I love <i>him</i>. After being told that I do, he will detect
      some slight change in my face or voice and cry out, 'Now, you don't like
      me&mdash;do you?' I am not sentimental, Uncle Tom, but that little chap's
      condition has worried me a lot. I pity him as I've never pitied a human
      being before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have often wondered whether Madge has taken notice of him,&rdquo; General
      Sylvester remarked, reflectively. &ldquo;A woman is hard to read on the surface,
      and while Madge never mentions Fred Walton's name any more than if he were
      dead, I've been afraid that the mere sight of his child might keep the old
      memory alive. Do you know, my son, a woman will condone exactly that
      failing in a man more quickly than any other? I suppose they lay most of
      the blame on the woman in the case. A high-strung creature like your
      sister wouldn't for a moment consider herself a rival of a fallen woman,
      and it may be that the explanation of her never having shown interest in
      other men is that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she still cares for the rascal?&rdquo; Dearing broke in, his face
      darkening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and that she still clings to some sort of faith in his constancy,&rdquo;
       the General added. &ldquo;You can't crush love in a woman's heart so long as she
      believes she is loved by a man who is longing for her and is kept away by
      adverse circumstances. You see, if our dear girl attributes Walton's
      predicament to a simple act of <i>low, impulsive passion</i>, and believes
      that he loved her, and her alone, in a <i>pure</i> way, why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, I see, and I am afraid you may be right,&rdquo; Dearing said, bitterly.
      &ldquo;And instead of curing her, the scoundrel's absence is only making the
      thing worse. Did you tell her about Kenneth's coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, only an hour ago, and it seemed to me that she was rather pleased.
      She remarked that she was glad John Dilk had kept up the place so well,
      and that the flowers would gratify him. I really fancied that she was more
      pleased by the news than she was willing to show, for she changed the
      subject by offering to play for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture a woman came round the house hurriedly, wiping her red,
      bare arms, and trying to adjust the damp dress she wore. It was Mrs.
      Chumley, the washerwoman. Her tawny hair was disarranged, and her fat,
      freckled face flushed with an excitement that was almost pleasurable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, here you are, Doctor Wynn!&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;I hain't been told to come;
      in fact, them highfalutin' neighbors of mine never let a body know
      anything they can get out of. But Mrs. Barry is having another of her
      falling spells. She was on the side porch brushing little Lionel's head
      when I heard her cry out to Dora for help, and then she struck the floor
      of the kitchen with a thump you could have heard up here if you'd been
      listening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll run down,&rdquo; Dearing said to his uncle. &ldquo;It may not be very
      serious. She is subject to such attacks.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>URRYING down
      through the grounds, and vaulting over the low boundary fence, Dearing
      approached the gate of the Barry cottage just as Dora came out. Pretty as
      she had been in girlhood, she was rarely beautiful as a fully developed
      woman. And to-day, as ever, Dearing stood before her in absolute awe of
      her rare, exquisite, and appealing personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's had another attack, Wynn!&rdquo; Dora said, with a brave effort to steady
      her faltering voice. &ldquo;I really thought she was dying, and I suppose I
      screamed. She looked so bad for a few moments! Her face turned purple, and
      she lost consciousness. She came to herself a moment ago, and is still
      awake. Will you see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went to the sick woman's room on tiptoe. Seated in a chair at the head
      of the bed, and waving a palm-leaf fan to and fro, to keep the flies from
      his grandmother's face, was Lionel, his great, serious eyes, so like his
      mother's, filled with anxiety. He rose as Dearing entered, and moved round
      to the other side of the bed, but he still waved the fan and stood staring
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I was gone that time, Doctor Wynn,&rdquo; Mrs. Barry said, with a wan
      smile, as he took her hand to test her pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you certainly are far from it now,&rdquo; he laughed, reassuringly. &ldquo;I
      believe it would take a regiment of soldiers to put you out of business.
      That was only a fainting spell brought on by too close confinement to the
      house. You must get out more; that's all you need. Now, take a good nap
      and you will be all right.&rdquo; He nodded and smiled reassuringly at Dora, who
      stood at the foot of the bed. She followed him from the room, seeing that
      he wished to speak to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is all right now,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;She is doing very well. It is only a
      sluggish liver, due to lack of exercise. Let her sleep as long as she will
      now, and I'll send you a tonic which will brace her up. There is nothing
      really to fear. She has a splendid constitution in all other respects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dora sank into a chair as if utterly overcome with relief, and he stood
      looking at her in blended admiration and sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from her beauty of face and form, there was a ripeness of intellect
      and character in her face, which had come to her from the years of
      isolated suffering which she had undergone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are so kind to me, Wynn,&rdquo; she said, with a faint, sad smile. &ldquo;You
      have always been the best friend we ever had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what are you talking about?&rdquo; Dearing said, lightly and with a flush.
      &ldquo;Any other jack-leg country doctor would have taken care of you fully as
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done hundreds of thoughtful things,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You have left
      nothing undone that could possibly help us. Oh, you are <i>too</i> good!
      You haven't allowed my poor mother to pay you one penny for your services
      in all these years. She has tried and tried to make you take it till she
      has almost given up in despair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't done anything really worth while, Dora,&rdquo; he said, lightly. &ldquo;You
      see, you live right at hand, too, and it is no trouble at all to jump over
      your fence and mine. I couldn't take money from a next-door neighbor under
      those circumstances. You just wait until you really need a doctor, and
      then I'll send in a bill as long as my arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't help being good,&rdquo; Dora said, feelingly, her wonderful violet
      eyes filling. &ldquo;Your great heart simply went out to us in our trouble, and
      you have determined to help us in every way possible. Mother thinks all
      the world of you, and Lionel actually believes you are some sort of god.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he's badly fooled, I tell you!&rdquo; Dearing laughed. &ldquo;But speaking of
      him, I must lecture you good and hard. You are not treating the child at
      all right. He oughtn't to be cooped up here in this little yard like he
      is. It is too small. A growing boy like that needs room, and plenty of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you don't understand!&rdquo; Dora sighed, while a look of deepest pain
      tortured her mobile face. &ldquo;I couldn't bear to have him running around a
      neighborhood as&mdash;as heartless as this one is. He is so observant, and
      has such an inquiring mind, and people are so&mdash;so cruel, so utterly
      unforgiving. But you are trying to change the subject. You think I have no
      money with which to pay a doctor's bill.&rdquo; She laughed suddenly and
      mysteriously as she went on: &ldquo;I believe I'll let you into a secret. I'll
      show you something. Come into the parlor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led him, with graceful step and bearing, through the little central
      passage of the cottage to the parlor door, and they entered together. She
      laughed like a merry child; it was the sweet, rippling laugh he remembered
      so well as belonging to his youth and hers, as she pointed to the easel
      before a window. On it was a good water-color picture of a child at play
      on the grass near a stream, with a pastoral scene sketched in the
      background.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he exclaimed, admiringly, &ldquo;that's the best you've shown me! It is
      very, very good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's only one of many,&rdquo; she said, shrugging her shoulders. &ldquo;I wanted
      something to occupy my mind after I gave up music, and I began these
      studies merely as an experiment. I worked for a year while Lionel was a
      baby just to&mdash;you know, Wynn&mdash;just to forget!&rdquo; He was silent,
      being unable to formulate any reply that was appropriate to the delicate
      situation, and she went on simply, and still in the winsome tone which had
      always appealed to him so strongly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;now comes the <i>best</i> part&mdash;one day I happened to
      read the advertisement of an Atlanta dealer who was in need of such
      things, and I forwarded some sketches I had done. They were bad&mdash;oh,
      so bad&mdash;and he wrote that he would not offer them to his customers,
      but he encouraged me to keep on. Then I worked harder, and finally I sent
      him some pictures of children&mdash;little pickaninnies, brown as
      chestnuts, little white ragamuffins, babies in old-fashioned, crude,
      box-cradles like the mountain people have, and he sold them. Think of
      that! He actually sold them! I have not signed any of them. He has written
      me several times begging that I should do so, but I have always refused.
      He has agreed not to use my name at all, and I believe he has kept his
      word. The whole thing has made me&mdash;<i>almost</i> happy. Wynn, I saw
      your face after your first successful operation, and didn't understand
      then what it meant to you, but I do now. The day that dealer's letter
      came, and his money followed by express, in a big wax-sealed envelope&mdash;well,
      it was the happiest moment of my life-I sang; I talked to myself; I
      danced. I told Baby all about it as I hugged him in my arms. I had, as
      they say, discovered myself. Here I was, cut off from intercourse with
      everybody in my home town, but God hadn't wholly forsaken me. He had given
      me something to make up for what I'd lost&mdash;a way of speaking to the
      big outer world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, and I congratulate you with all my heart,&rdquo; Dearing said, as he
      stood watching the shifting tones in her expressive face. &ldquo;I understand
      you better now. I got in the habit of listening for your piano at night,
      when everything was still, and I fancied I could read your various moods.
      A long time ago you played too sadly; really it used to get next to me,
      and make me worry about you; but of late there has been more hope and
      cheerfulness in your music, and it did me a lot of good. I understand you
      better now. I have always thought that creative work was the most
      satisfying and uplifting occupation possible, and now I am sure of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am getting better and better prices, too,&rdquo; Dora said, modestly. &ldquo;My
      agent sends my things everywhere, even to far-off New York and Boston. I
      don't do them so fast now, for I try harder and I think they are better.
      Now, you will send me your bill, won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall certainly be hoping that somebody will get really sick under this
      roof,&rdquo; he laughed, evasively, &ldquo;for I'd like to get a whack at your roll of
      cash, but so far my dealings have been only with your mother, and she
      doesn't make it interesting. She was good to me when I was a boy. I used
      to crawl over the back fence when she was making jelly and jam in the
      kitchen, and I collected some fees then that did me more good than any I
      have since received. She performed the first surgical operation on me,
      too, that I ever had. I was barefoot, and while trying to hide from some
      other boys I stuck a rusty nail through my big toe. She heard me yelling
      and came to my assistance. She extracted the nail, washed out my wound,
      filled it with turpentine&mdash;the only household antiseptic used in that
      day&mdash;and bound it up for me. I have always believed that she saved me
      from lockjaw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The opportunity to earn money means more to me than you might think,
      Wynn,&rdquo; she said, her eyes lighting up. &ldquo;Do you know what my dream of
      dreams is? It is to be able to go to Paris, and take Lionel and my mother.
      She has always wanted to go, because papa was buried there. Do you know, I
      feel that away off in a free, art-loving country like France I could rear
      my child to manhood without his ever knowing about his&mdash;his history.
      It seems to me that God has given me this talent for that particular
      purpose. The only trouble is the delay. You see, it may be years before I
      can save enough, and then it might be too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, I understand,&rdquo; Dearing said, gravely; &ldquo;and you'd never come back
      to old Stafford again, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;all this would have to be laid aside forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't like to see you go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have&mdash;you see, I have
      become attached to Lionel&mdash;he and I are great chums. But if you have
      decided, and wish it so very much, why not? Look here, Dora, I have money
      lying idle in the bank. I have absolutely no need for it, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It is lovely of you to offer it, but I couldn't think
      of taking it. I couldn't&mdash;I really-couldn't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not from your big brother?&rdquo; he asked, his pleading eyes on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not even from you, you dear boy. It is <i>my</i> problem, Wynn, and I
      must work it out alone&mdash;all alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had gone back to the porch, and the sight of the extensive grounds
      around his house prompted him to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know now why you don't realize Lionel's need for more fresh air. You
      have that absorbing occupation, and it keeps you from putting yourself in
      the boy's place, as you might otherwise do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; she asked, quite gravely. &ldquo;It may be true, Wynn, and
      yet what am I to do? I really can't bear to have him running about,
      meeting other children. I could never answer his questions&mdash;never,
      never! Some one would have to watch him, and mother and I both shrink from
      going out in&mdash;in public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking of that, too,&rdquo; Dearing replied, &ldquo;and that is why a certain
      plan occurred to me. There is that big lot of mine right over the fence.
      Nothing could possibly happen to him there. It is quiet, and there are
      many things he could amuse himself with. It is really like a little farm,
      you know. We have chickens, ducks, turkeys, puppies, kittens, pigs, and
      horses, and even a cow and a calf about the barn, to say nothing of the
      pigeons that nest in the hay-loft. To a child, judging by my own memory of
      boyhood, it would be a regular paradise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean that you would allow&mdash;that you would&mdash;&rdquo; There
      was a catch in the young mother's voice; a tinge of anxious pallor crept
      into her appealing face. &ldquo;Oh, Wynn, you are too kind! You are thinking
      only of helping me. There is your uncle and your sister&mdash;I could not
      bear to trust my darling where he might not be&mdash;wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know my uncle and sister better than you do,&rdquo; Dearing said. &ldquo;Margaret
      has never seen Lionel that I know of, but she would love to make him
      happy. As for my uncle, he greatly admires the little fellow, and would be
      delighted to have him come and romp over the place to his heart's
      content.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how you tempt me!&rdquo; Dora cried, covering her face with her shapely
      hands. &ldquo;Of all things, I can think of nothing right now that I'd like
      better than that. I have been trying to forget Lionel's confinement in
      this little yard and house&mdash;trying to convince myself that he is
      wholly happy only with mother and me, but it is no use. It is really
      pitiful to think of. He has a wonderful imagination, and he sometimes sits
      here on the porch and tries to picture to himself what the inside of a big
      house like yours is. He thinks you all must be kings and princes like
      those in the fairy-tales we read to him. He asked me one day if we'd ever
      have a home like yours, and when I told him I didn't think so, he
      answered, 'Then God isn't so very good, after all, is He?' I tried to get
      him to explain what he meant, but he only shook his head and went to play
      in the yard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the boy himself came from his grandmother's room, along the
      passage, and out to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is still asleep,&rdquo; he announced, gravely. &ldquo;I drew the netting over her
      face, so that the flies won't wake her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right&mdash;that's a good boy.&rdquo; Dearing rested his strong hand on
      the golden head and looked down into the child's face, and then he laughed
      as he caught the boy's arm and taught him how to contract his muscles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be able to protect yourself, young man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have a
      splendid arm and fist already. I'd hate to have those knuckles try to
      knock a fly off my nose and miss the fly. Say, kid, do you see that big
      lot of mine beyond the fence? Well, you are going to play over there from
      morning to night: climb the trees, build houses out of that pile of old
      bricks. I'm going to have a swing put up for you to the highest limb of
      that big oak, and I'll make you a see-saw and a flying-jinny, and you may
      feed my puppies and cats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy's eyes danced as he stared eagerly. Dora was looking away, her
      handkerchief pressed to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dearing saw a wave of emotion pass through her, but she remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I couldn't go over there!&rdquo; Lionel sighed. &ldquo;You are very kind, but my
      mother always wants me to stay at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is going to let you come, because I asked it as a special favor to
      me,&rdquo; Dearing answered. &ldquo;I'm the doctor, you know, and my orders go on this
      ranch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wonderingly, the boy leaned across his mother's lap, and put his arm
      around her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he joking, mother dear?&rdquo; he inquired, and he held his breath in
      visible suspense. &ldquo;Does he really mean that I may play over there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like it, darling boy?&rdquo; Dora asked. There was a tremolo in her
      voice, and she kept her handkerchief to her eyes. The child started,
      looked suspiciously at Dearing, and then, leaning toward his mother, he
      firmly uncovered her face. He saw traces of tears, and stood erect. There
      was a fierce, angry flare in his eyes, his lower lip quivered, as he
      turned upon Dearing and blurted out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is crying! What did you say to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see!&rdquo; Dearing jested. &ldquo;You want to have it out with me, do you?
      Well, you pick your weapons, old chap, and I'll be your man. I won't take
      a dare from you or anybody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dora's arms enfolded her child and pressed his hot cheek passionately to
      hers. &ldquo;Yes, I was crying, my baby,&rdquo; she gulped, &ldquo;but it is because I am so
      happy. It is very good of Doctor Wynn to ask you to go. Would you like
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wished me to,&rdquo; the boy replied, slowly, as he still uneasily
      studied her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like it very much,&rdquo; Dora said&mdash;&ldquo;very, very much! You could
      have such a splendid time over there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you love me just the same&mdash;<i>just exactly</i> the same&mdash;if
      I went?&rdquo; the boy asked, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just exactly the same.&rdquo; Dora laughed as she caught Dearing's glance, and
      remarked to him, in an undertone: &ldquo;He is such a strange child! Mother says
      she has never seen one so peculiarly sensitive and concerned over trifles.
      He often comes in from his play for nothing else than to ask me if I still
      love him. The slightest change in my manner or tone of voice always brings
      out that one question. It is the last thing at night and the first thing
      in the morning. If I am at all impatient with him, when I am absorbed in
      my work, he will come and sit on the floor at my feet, and nothing will
      satisfy him till I have taken him in my arms and said over and over again
      that I love him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is his nature,&rdquo; Dearing said, as he was turning to leave. &ldquo;Well,
      remember, my boy, that my gate is not locked, and if you don't come over
      in my big lot, I'll come and ride you there on my back, like a two-legged
      horse; and I might get scared and kick up my heels and dump you over on
      your head.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>NE warm, fair
      afternoon in May, Kenneth Galt, at the earnest solicitation of General
      Sylvester, came home. Under big captions the Stafford papers had proudly
      given the particulars to the public. The great man was slightly run down
      from the enormous duties which had pressed upon him since the very
      beginning of his giant enterprise, and was to take a long and much-needed
      rest in the town of his birth and in the quiet old house where he had
      spent his boyhood. The mayor and aldermen and a brass-band had met him as
      he stepped from his private car at the station, and he was welcomed with
      spirited music and a short but ponderous speech on the part of the mayor.
      Then John Dilk, in a new suit of clothes and a much-worn silk top-hat,
      haughtily drove his master and the doting General through the streets,
      across the square, and on to the old Galt mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd which had followed the carriage from the station to the square
      gradually dispersed, and the two friends were alone when they alighted at
      the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see those chairs and that table under the oaks on our lawn?&rdquo;
       Sylvester asked, with the bubbling pride of a boy in a victorious ball
      game, as they were strolling up the wide moss-grown brick walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Galt nodded, and smiled tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madge is going to give us a cup of tea outdoors,&rdquo; Sylvester explained.
      &ldquo;It was her own idea. It is warm inside, and that is the shadiest, coolest
      spot in Stafford. The tea will refresh us. Shall we go now, or do you want
      to nose over the old house first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see Mrs. Wilson looking out from a window,&rdquo; Galt answered. &ldquo;I think I'd
      better go in for a moment, anyway. The good old soul is in her best bib
      and tucker, and might feel hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are!&rdquo; the General said, approvingly. &ldquo;You haven't risen too
      high, my boy, to think of those dependent on you. Run in and take
      possession, and I'll stir Madge up. A cup of tea of my particular blend
      will do you good after your dusty ride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His niece was coming across the grass as the old gentleman reached the
      tea-table. Her arms were full of fresh-cut roses, which she proceeded to
      arrange in an old-fashioned silver punch-bowl in the centre of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you heard the band and cheering?&rdquo; the old man said, as he stood
      watching her and rubbing his thin hands together in suppressed delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; Margaret laughed; &ldquo;and from my window I saw you and your
      conquering hero drive up in state. Well, did he accept our invitation or
      shirk it, as they say he usually does with everything of the sort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, he seemed glad to be asked,&rdquo; returned the General. &ldquo;In
      fact, it looks to me like he's happy to be home again, though one can
      never tell. The active life of great success in any line estranges men
      from the simpler things. Just think of it! The fellow has lived in hotels,
      clubs, and that private car of his for the last six years. He has not, if
      I remember correctly, been once inside his old home since the night I sent
      him whizzing like a shot to New York. I do hope it won't become irksome to
      him. He needs rest and quiet badly, as you will see when he comes over.
      His face has a few new lines, and his eyes have a shifting, restless look
      which they didn't use to show. Where are you going to have him sit?&rdquo; The
      old man was looking over the cluster of chairs and cushioned stools.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, his lordship may take his high and mighty choice!&rdquo; Margaret laughed,
      teasingly. &ldquo;Perhaps he'll unbend and sit on the grass like a school-boy.
      He is, after all, only flesh and blood, dear uncle, odd as the fact may
      seem to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don't hurl that sort of thing at <i>him</i>,&rdquo; Sylvester retorted,
      rather testily. &ldquo;After all, a man not much over forty, who succeeds in an
      enterprise which belongs to the history of the land, and at the same time
      puts money into your pocket and mine in big lumps and rolls, does deserve
      consideration. Why, he has made you rich, Madge! He could have located his
      terminal shops and round-house at the other end of town just as well, but
      he put them on our land and asked no questions about the price. By George,
      why <i>shouldn't</i> we pet him a little when he has been away all these
      years, and has come back broken down this way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, I don't think he needs it, that's all,&rdquo; the young lady said,
      pacifically. &ldquo;A man like that is neither sugar nor salt. Only <i>weak</i>
      men want to be pampered and cajoled. Your railway magnate will take care
      of himself.&rdquo; Her eyes were resting on the figure of a child in a big swing
      which Doctor Dearing had hung from the lower branch of a tall oak a few
      yards away. It was Dora Barry's son. He was standing on the board seat
      clasping the stout hemp ropes with his little hands and &ldquo;pumping&rdquo; himself
      into motion by alternately bending and straightening his lithe body. His
      beautiful golden hair swung loose in the breeze, there was a glow of
      health in his pink cheeks, and he was neatly dressed in white duck, a
      flowing necktie, and tan slippers and short stockings which exposed his
      perfect calves and trim ankles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Margaret suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;I'm afraid he will fall! Wynn is
      always doing such absurd things; the child is not old enough to take such
      risks as that with no one to watch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; the General said, and he went to the swing and
      persuaded Lionel to sit down. Then he pushed him forward, and left him
      swinging gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just think of it!&rdquo; Sylvester said, as he came back to his niece, who sat
      now with her glance on the grass. &ldquo;Time certainly flies. That specimen of
      humanity has come into existence and grown to that size since Kenneth was
      here. I don't think he ever knew the poor girl very well before her
      misfortune, but he is sorry for her. I remember speaking to him of her in
      New York one day, and I could see that he was quite interested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I see him coming now,&rdquo; Margaret said, biting her lip. It was the
      way she had always avoided any conversation which touched upon the one
      sore spot of her life, and her uncle refrained, as he had always done,
      from carrying the topic further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is coming,&rdquo; and Sylvester stood up and waved his handkerchief.
      &ldquo;Come and take the place of honor,&rdquo; he said, picking up a downy pillow and
      laying it in the big chair next to Margaret's. &ldquo;I am glad there never was
      a fence between your place and ours, for we can mix and mingle as we did
      when your father and I were young bloods. I've made a mistake many a night
      in having my horse put up in his stable after the dumb brute had brought
      me home from a dance in the country with more intelligence than I
      possessed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galt laughed appreciatively as he bent over the fair hand of his hostess
      and received her simple and yet cordial greeting. He had admired her as a
      girl, and now in her ripened beauty, added grace, and dignified bearing he
      found nothing lacking. As he watched her deftly lighting the spirit-lamp
      under the swinging teakettle he recalled, with a certain sense of
      delectation, a hint her uncle had given him in a jesting tone and yet with
      a serious look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may have you in my family one day, young man,&rdquo; the General had said, in
      some talk over their common business interests, &ldquo;and in that case I'll
      rule you with a rod of iron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After all, it would be nice, Galt reflected to-day, and a step of that
      sort might ultimately quiet the dull aching of heart which had been his
      for so many years. Few men had ever had to such a marked degree the
      pronounced yearning toward paternity as had come to the lonely bachelor
      since the chief mistake of his life. His love for children was more like
      that of a woman who has tasted and lost the joys of motherhood than that
      of a man of the world. He never saw a pretty child without looking at its
      father with a sort of envious curiosity. Was the remainder of his life to
      be passed without his possessing that for which he yearned more than for
      any other earthly thing? He had heard, of course, of the birth of Dora's
      child, but he had so persistently fought off the thought of it and its
      attendant remorse that, like many another man so situated, his sense of
      responsibility in the matter had become somewhat dulled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now ventured, during the General's jovial chatter, to glance across the
      lawn toward the cottage below. It was there in the starlight that he had
      seen the brave young girl for the last time. It was there. And he
      shuddered under the scourging lash of the words with which she had
      prophesied that he would fail to stand by her&mdash;fail to rescue her
      from the abyss into which he had plunged her. He shuddered again. Hero as
      he was in the sight of many, in Dora's eyes, at least, he could never be
      aught but despicable. She had gauged his weakness better than he could
      have done it himself. He had made a choice between honor and ambition, and
      he had abided by it. Other men had cast such memories to the winds of
      oblivion. Why had his clung to him with such damning tenacity? There was
      never any satisfactory answer to the question, and now and then a thought
      as from infinite space was hurled upon him with the force of a catapult&mdash;it
      was the conviction that, girl though she had been, Dora Barry's equal, in
      the intellectual and womanly things he admired, was not to be found among
      all the women he had known. What was she like now? What havoc had the
      tragedy and succeeding time wrought in the fair being whom he had left
      stranded and storm-swept on that eventful night? Under the low roof and in
      the tiny yard of the cottage just across the way she and his child,
      according to Wynn Dearing's report, had been imprisoned all those years.
      What a rebuke to his boundless egotism! He might remain there for years,
      and neither of the two would intrude themselves upon him. Oh yes, he told
      himself, he was safe enough on that score. She had kept her vow of secrecy
      so far, and would do so to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture there was a rippling scream of childish delight behind
      him, and, turning, he saw Lionel, his face flushed, his great eyes full of
      excitement, as he eagerly chased a black kitten round and round a bed of
      rose-bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a beautiful boy!&rdquo; Galt exclaimed, beside himself in admiration.
      &ldquo;What a perfect figure! Whose child is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question was addressed to Margaret; but she hesitated, tightened her
      lips, and looked down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is one of our neighbor's,&rdquo; the General skilfully interjected, as
      he leaned forward and tried ineffectually to give his guest a warning
      glance. &ldquo;Wynn is a great hand at amusing the little ones. He thought this
      child needed more exercise and fresh air, and he asked his mother to let
      it play here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galt was now watching the boy, and so intently that he only half heard
      what the General said and quite failed to notice that his question had
      embarrassed his hostess. &ldquo;Catch it! Run round the other way, little man!&rdquo;
       he cried out, leaning forward with his cup in his hand. &ldquo;There! there it
      goes!&rdquo; The child paused just an instant, and raised his appealing,
      long-lashed eyes to the speaker; as he did so the kitten bounded like a
      rabbit across the grass and up a tree a few yards away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, see what <i>you</i> did!&rdquo; Lionel cried, disappointedly, as he stood
      panting, his silken tresses tossed about his face. &ldquo;You let him get away.
      I'd have had him if you hadn't spoken. But I don't care, I can get him!&rdquo;
       And he was off like the wind toward the tree, on a lower bough of which
      the kitten was perched, blandly eying his pursuer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are as fond of children as ever,&rdquo; the General remarked, &ldquo;and it
      proves that your heart is in the right spot. Show me a man who has no use
      for little tots, and I'll show you a man who will cheat you in a
      transaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly is a good quality,&rdquo; Margaret said, as she proffered sugar
      for his tea. &ldquo;We naturally expect it of women, but it always seems
      exceptional in men, especially men who have their time fully occupied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester laughed reminiscently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've seen Kenneth stop on the street to chat with a dirty-faced newsboy
      when the general superintendent of his road was waving an important
      telegram at him; and I've seen the boy walk off with a quarter for a penny
      paper, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seem to be getting my share of compliments, at any rate,&rdquo; Galt laughed.
      &ldquo;I'd call it flattery if I could accuse your hospitality of anything not
      wholly genuine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Tom certainly means what he says,&rdquo; Margaret affirmed. Her glance
      drifted in the direction the sporting child had taken, and she uttered a
      sharp, startled scream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he'll fall!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following her eyes, the others saw that Lionel, still chasing the kitten,
      had climbed the tree to its lower boughs ten or twelve feet from the
      ground, and, with the prize still above him, sat in a decidedly perilous
      position on a bending branch so intent on reaching the animal that he was
      oblivious of his danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be frightened, I'll get him down,&rdquo; Galt assured her, with an easy
      laugh, and he sprang up and ran across the grass, saying, under his
      breath: &ldquo;Plucky little scamp! He'll break his neck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come down from there!&rdquo; he called out, a queer recurrence of his own
      childhood on him as he viewed the muscular boy and the plump, bare calves
      above his short stockings. He was breathing freely now, for he felt that
      in case of a fall he could catch the youngster in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do let me get him!&rdquo; Lionel cried, looking down appealingly, and
      speaking with the accent which had always impressed hearers as so quaint
      and odd in a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you mustn't go a bit higher!&rdquo; Galt said, assuming a youthful tone of
      comradery that his words might not have any semblance of command. &ldquo;You are
      a dandy climber&mdash;almost as good as the cat, but he is lighter than
      you are. You'll break that limb in a minute, and down you will tumble!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy looked at the bending bough and shrugged his square shoulders. &ldquo;I
      don't know but what you are right,&rdquo; he said, with a wry face. &ldquo;I declare,
      I wasn't looking where I was going. I'm almost afraid to move now.&rdquo; Then
      he burst into a merry laugh as he glanced first at his would-be rescuer
      and then up at the cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what is so amusing about it?&rdquo; Galt questioned, fairly transported by
      the boy's beauty, fearlessness, and vivacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't know, but it seems funny&mdash;you down there, me up here,
      and the cat above us both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galt laughed till tears came into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are certainly a marvel,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But you must come down. Slide
      carefully toward the trunk of the tree and catch hold of it firmly. You'll
      tear your clothes, but it is better that than&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know an easier way!&rdquo; the child cried. &ldquo;I'll jump, and you catch me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can't!&rdquo; Galt answered. &ldquo;You'd crush me to the ground, small as you
      are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I wouldn't!&rdquo; Lionel laughed, with thorough confidence. &ldquo;Doctor Wynn
      caught me the other day when I jumped from the roof of the wagon-shed, and
      you are stronger than he is. You are taller, anyway. Look, I am coming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fascinated by the child's voice and manner, and unable to protest quickly
      enough, Galt braced himself, fearing that the swaying child would fall.
      &ldquo;One, two, <i>three!</i> Lionel counted, and the little white-clothed
      figure left the bough, shot through the sunlight, and alighted in Galt's
      outstretched arms. There was a scream from Margaret, the General stood up,
      a startled look on his gashed and seamed face. The child's arms went round
      Galt's neck; his soft, warm cheek was pressed against his, and, scarcely
      knowing why he did it, Galt embraced him in a veritable qualm of relief.
      He put the boy down, but took his hands in his and held them. He admired
      and loved children, but he had never been so drawn to one before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's all right!&rdquo; he called out, reassuringly, to the others. &ldquo;He didn't
      get a scratch, but it's a wonder he wasn't lamed for life. He jumped
      before I could stop him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Looking into the child's sensitive face, Galt noted, with surprise and
      concern, that it was clouded over. &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; he asked,
      anxiously. &ldquo;Did you hurt yourself? Did it jar you too much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I'm afraid you are angry with me,&rdquo; the boy answered. &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not exactly, but, you see, my boy&mdash;&rdquo; Galt checked himself, for
      the corners of the little fellow's mouth were drawn down and his eyes were
      filling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>are</i> angry, and you don't like me a bit.&rdquo; A sob rose in the
      breast of the child and struggled outward. He drew his little hands from
      Galt's detaining clasp and looked down. &ldquo;I am very sorry; I'll never,
      never do it again. I was bad. You told me not to jump, but I did. I am
      always disobeying somebody. When Doctor Wynn told me a great, smart, rich
      man was coming who had built a railroad, miles and miles through the woods
      and under mountains and over rivers, I told him I'd be good and make you
      think I was a nice boy, so that you'd like me; but now, you see, I went
      and made you angry at the very start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what if I tell you this, you dear little chap,&rdquo; and Galt paused and
      took him into his arms again; &ldquo;what if I tell you that it was because I
      liked you very, very much that I tried to stop you? You see, I was afraid
      you'd get hurt, and I liked you so much that I wanted to prevent it. Will
      that satisfy you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Galt felt the little, warm arm steal round his neck confidently.
      &ldquo;Then you really <i>do</i> like me, after all.&rdquo; Galt laughed; he could
      hardly understand the emotion that welled up in him&mdash;he laughed that
      he might hide it even from himself. &ldquo;I'll tell you <i>this</i> much,&rdquo; he
      said: &ldquo;I like <i>nearly all</i> little boys, but on my honor I never liked
      a boy, on a short acquaintance, in my life, so much as I do you. There,
      now, come on and get a cup of tea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With Lionel in his arms, he went back to the table and sat down, keeping
      him in his lap. There was a sensitive shadow on Margaret's features and a
      certain awkward look of sympathy for her on her uncle's strong face, but
      Galt failed to remark them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your mamma let you drink tea?&rdquo; Margaret asked, gently. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I thank you,&rdquo; the child answered. &ldquo;She says it's too strong a stim&mdash;stim&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stimulant.&rdquo; Galt supplied the word with a hearty laugh of amusement. &ldquo;I
      declare, for a child, you have the largest vocabulary&mdash;if you know
      what that is&mdash;that I ever ran across. By-the-way&rdquo;&mdash;and he drew
      the boy's head down against his breast and ran his hand through the soft,
      scented tresses&mdash;&ldquo;you haven't told me your name yet. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lionel,&rdquo; replied the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is pretty enough so far as it goes, but what else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by 'what else'?&rdquo; The child had hold of Galt's disengaged
      hand, and was toying with it as if admiring its strength and size, and he
      paused to look up into the dark face bending over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I mean, what is your <i>full</i> name?&rdquo; Galt said, smiling into the
      rather grave faces about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lionel&mdash;just Lionel, that's all,&rdquo; the child said, and he raised
      Galt's hand in both of his own and pressed it. &ldquo;Most people have two
      names, but I've never had but one. I don't know why. Do you? I asked my
      mother about it one day when Mrs. Chumley was talking mean to her about
      me, and mamma went off to her room and cried. Grandmother told me never to
      speak of it to her again. My mother has two names&mdash;Dora Barry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth Galt felt as though his soul had suddenly died within him. The
      bonny head of his own child lay on his breast, its throbbing warmth
      striking through to his pulseless heart. Margaret sat rigid and
      speechless, and General Sylvester, in his desire to shield her, began
      chattering irrelevantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long shadows of the descending sun crawled across the grass toward the
      hill in the east. The golden head remained where it lay, the tiny and yet
      vigorous fingers twined themselves about the larger inanimate ones. The
      eyelids over the boy's big, dreamy orbs wavered and drooped. He was tired
      and sleepy. He heaved a long, fragrant sigh and nestled more snugly into
      the arms that held him. A great, voiceless yearning born of the
      long-buried paternal instinct fired the dry tinder&mdash;the driftwood of
      years of misguided loneliness&mdash;in the man's being. A great light
      seemed to burst and blaze above him. He sat with his gaze on the old man's
      face, but in fancy he felt himself kissing the parted lips of that marvel
      of creation&mdash;Dora's child and his.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>IX years had
      wrought a wonderful change in Gate City. It had increased in size and
      importance. Stephen Whipple was still the only wholesale grocer of the
      place, and Fred Walton had become his chief assistant. He was known to be
      the old man's special favorite, and was living on the footing of a son in
      the Whipple household.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day that Kenneth Galt had returned to Stafford, Fred and his
      employer were seated in the old man's private office. Whipple had opened
      his heart to him in regard to a certain financial development which had
      gone against his interests. The old grocer's pride had been wounded as it
      had never been wounded before. Since the starting of the business he had
      been specially proud of the fact that he had been able to supply the
      retail dealers of Gate City with the groceries consumed by their customers
      as cheaply as any of the far-off markets could do, even with the freight
      cost added.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in competing with his rivals for the patronage of the town, an
      ambitious retail dealer&mdash;a certain J. B. Thorp&mdash;to cut at
      Whipple, who had refused him further credit, owing to Thorp's
      unwillingness to meet his bills when due, began to advertise that the
      reason he could undersell his rivals was that he didn't stop at home to
      buy his supplies. This had evoked a sharp retort in &ldquo;a card&rdquo; in the town
      papers from the offended Whipple, and it had brought out further and more
      sarcastic allusions from Thorp. He said that it was as plain as the nose
      on anybody's face that a man could not have waxed so rich as the money
      king of Gate City had done except at the expense of the public, and he
      scored a commercial triumph by giving therewith a list of his retail
      prices for that day, which, on staple wares at least, were really as low
      as Whipple's salesmen could give their customers at wholesale.
    </p>
    <p>
      The publicity of the whole thing had a bad effect on the old man's
      clientèle. The shrewd retailer chuckled with gratified revenge as he saw
      the public fairly streaming his way. The stores which were being supplied
      by Whipple were absolutely inactive. The clerks stood on the sidewalk
      ruefully regarding the human current, and, by way of amusement, laying
      wagers on the outgoings of Thorp's loaded delivery wagons, each of which
      now bore an American flag, with a motto in big black letters: &ldquo;Live and
      Let Live! Down with the Money God of Gate City!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whipple's salesmen made their usual rounds among his patrons, only to meet
      with utter stagnation on every hand, and returned with long faces to
      report few if any sales. Consumers, quick to secure even an ephemeral
      advantage, were easily convinced that Thorp was working for their
      interests, and they stood by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I reckon we can make shift some way, my boy,&rdquo; the old man sighed;
      &ldquo;for our business out of town is widening and growing; but in all my life
      I never was hit under the belt as bad as this, for I did want to hold my
      own here at home. And to think that I am done, and done good, by that
      measly Thorp, simply because we pinned down on him and forced him to pay
      up. It hurts like salt rubbed in a sore to be treated this way, after all
      I've done for the town. The boys say our best customers are paying more
      money than we ask right now in the Eastern markets in the effort to
      counteract Thorp's trickery. Do you know, I'd draw my check this minute
      for ten thousand round dollars and pay it to anybody who will show me a
      way to crush that sneaking scamp. Put the boys on their mettle, Fred; tell
      'em I said fresh ideas are better than stale ones, and the man that helps
      me out of this tight hole will be well paid for his trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was hoping that it would die out in a few days,&rdquo; said Walton, &ldquo;but it
      has only grown worse. Thorp has got the upper hand, and the more we fight
      him the bigger advertisement he gets out of it. Johnston and Wells say
      they can't possibly make the payment they promised this month, owing to
      the big slump in their sales.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I didn't expect it!&rdquo; Whipple groaned, his head resting on his fat
      hand. &ldquo;And the trouble is, the thing may drive many of our customers clean
      to the wall. Thorp would sell groceries for no profit at all for twelve
      months to swamp the others. The public are getting low prices, the Lord
      knows, but it means the ruin of regular trade and the desperation of good,
      energetic business men. Look here, Fred, we must down that rascal, I tell
      you. Start the boys to thinking. Surely among us we can turn up some plan
      or other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do what I can, Mr. Whipple,&rdquo; Walton promised, as he stood up and
      opened the door for the old man, who had desperately snatched his hat from
      its hook on the wall and was ponderously striding out.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had left the store, Fred called Dick Warren to him from his high
      stool in the counting-room. With his increased years and regular life Dick
      had vastly improved in appearance. He hadn't risen so rapidly as his
      friend, but he was a capable bookkeeper, a fine salesman, and a steady,
      accurate worker, who earned a good salary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This thing has hit the old man hard, Dick,&rdquo; Walton said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody can see it by the way he walks with his head down like that,&rdquo;
       Dick returned. &ldquo;The house can stand it, of course, with all its
      out-of-town support, but Gate City trade was the old man's pet, and I'll
      be blamed if it doesn't look like he'll never get any more of it. It
      actually gives a store a black eye to have any of our brands on sale. Jim
      Wilson said just now that he'd take a keg of our soda if we'd scrape our
      name off of it. I gave him a piece of my mind, but he said we were looking
      to our interests and he was looking to his. I had no idea the people of
      this town could be such blasted fools!&rdquo; and, considerably disgruntled,
      Dick went back to his post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several days passed. The situation was no better. Thorp had induced one of
      the railroads to build a sidetrack from the main line to a platform in the
      rear of his store, and Eastern goods were being unloaded in wholesale
      quantities right on the premises. He was also advertising for a vacant
      house in which to accommodate the overflow of his business. The only
      available one on the street belonged to Whipple, and that, of course, he
      couldn't rent at any price.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among those most concerned, though rather indirectly, was the Rev. Luke
      Matthews. He was seeing his rich patron in a new light, for, now that he
      was in trouble, old Whipple had less time to devote to the uplifting of
      humanity, either spiritually or materially, and he often denied himself to
      the minister's frequent calls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just wait till I get my head above water,&rdquo; Whipple said once, when
      Matthews clutched his arm and essayed to speak of a matter concerning the
      church. &ldquo;I reckon I'm worldly minded, Brother Matthews, but a man has to
      be tainted that way to fight worldly matters. Right now I am as full of
      Old Nick as I ever was in my worst days. I know it; I feel it; but, by
      gum! I am not ashamed. Day and night prayers wouldn't move a rascally
      skunk like Thorp. He was my friend as long as he could suck my blood, and
      now he is my worst enemy because I wouldn't let him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the weeks passed, matters only grew worse for the wholesale store. Its
      town customers dropped off till local business amounted to nothing at all.
      One morning the merchant walked the full length of the main street. He
      went up one side to the court-house at the far end, and then slowly
      returned on the other side. On the way he met Matthews, who told him
      something he had not heard, and he walked on, now more slowly than ever.
      As he was passing through the counting-room on his way to his private
      office he paused between the stools on which Fred and Dick were seated.
      His face was ashen in color, his lower lip was quivering like that of a
      weeping child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think is in the wind now, boys?&rdquo; he gulped, as he placed an
      unsteady hand on Fred's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no idea,&rdquo; Fred answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the balance have combined,&rdquo; Whipple groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&mdash;what?&mdash;how combined?&rdquo; Fred asked, wondering if his old
      friend was not actually losing his reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, all the other retailers have formed a pool to beat Thorp, and in
      doing it they have knifed me. They have formed a combine to buy their
      stuff in St. Louis and New York in order to get car-load rates. They had a
      caucus last night in the rear end of Thompson &amp; White's shebang, and
      the last one signed up. They don't buy a thing from us&mdash;the man who
      spends a nickel at this house loses his membership. They are a lot of
      sneaking curs, to pull me down and stamp on me just because that scamp's
      upset business, but they done it. The thing will spread all over the
      State, and I'll be laughed at as a doddering old idiot. Folks like nothing
      better than to see a successful man get it in the neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I passed along the street just now they slunk away from their doors,
      so I couldn't see 'em laugh. They call <i>themselves</i> 'wholesale men'
      now, and say they are going to oust me and Thorp both&mdash;make us count
      cross-ties out of town. I've had insults in my time, but being yoked with
      that skunk is a dose I can't swallow. I'm beat, and beat bad. If there was
      a loophole to crawl out at&mdash;if I could take one single step to defend
      myself&mdash;I'd give away half I've accumulated to be able to do it. My
      money paid for two-thirds of the Belgian-block pavement around the park; I
      gave more than half that was subscribed to the girls' school-building, and
      paid, entire, for the wall round the graveyard, to say nothing of what I
      put in the fire company, and new engines at the gas-works. I done those
      things, boys, for the town they live in, and yet they can drag my name in
      the mire and throw mud and slime on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned suddenly and left them, striding on to his desk in the adjoining
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old fellow!&rdquo; Dick said. &ldquo;Nothing on earth could have cut his pride
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he could only hit back in some substantial way,&rdquo; Walton reflected,
      aloud. &ldquo;Think of some plan, Dick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of nothing!&rdquo; the younger man said, gloomily. &ldquo;Of all things on
      earth, I never could have dreamt of those fellows combining that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment later a postman came in with a bundle of letters and handed them
      to Fred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks like they are getting you fellows in the nine hole at last,&rdquo; he
      said, with a laugh. &ldquo;Every grocer on the street is putting out a big sign.
      One of them has got a picture of the old man with a handkerchief to his
      eyes standing in a store without a single customer, while all the crowd is
      headed for another place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we'll have to wait and see,&rdquo; Fred retorted, angrily. &ldquo;I must give
      these letters to Mr. Whipple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he went in the old man's office, he found the grocer pacing up and
      down, his hat in his hand, his brow dark with passion. He waved the
      letters from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open 'em yourself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm going home. I feel like a candidate on
      election night who didn't get a vote in his own precinct. I don't intend
      to stay down here where everybody can pick at me. I heard what that whelp
      said to you and Dick. They are all gloating over me like buzzards over a
      dead ox. When you come up to supper, bring the night mail with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He strode from the room, and Fred heard his despondent step on the
      resounding floor all the way to the rear door of the long house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred worked over his books and out-of-town orders till near sunset; then
      he took down his coat and hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might work,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;At any rate, there can be no harm in asking
      him about it.&rdquo; He went out, and, turning into a quiet side-street, he
      walked up to the comfortable home of his employer, which stood on a slight
      elevation among the best houses of the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occupied a small lot, as did its neighbors, and there were no grass or
      flowers about it. It was built of yellow bricks, and had a porch in front,
      against which, on a lattice, some vines were growing.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he entered the gate an elderly woman approached the front door and
      stood waiting for him. It was Stephen Whipple's wife, a gaunt woman in a
      simple black dress without ornament, and wearing her iron-gray hair
      brushed smoothly over her brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are earlier than usual,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hope you have good news. I
      don't think he can stand it much longer. I have never seen him so much
      troubled in my life. His pride is cut to the quick. He has always thought
      he could cope with trickery in any form, and being helpless this way under
      the taunts of those men is fairly killing him. If he was thoroughly at
      himself he might hold his own, but he is getting old, and being mad this
      way really keeps him from using his best judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nothing has turned up yet,&rdquo; Fred told her; &ldquo;but I thought I'd speak
      to him before supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he'll be glad to see you, anyway,&rdquo; the woman said, plaintively. &ldquo;He
      thinks a lot of you, Fred&mdash;in fact, we both do. He has often said he
      blesses the day you came to him. He is lying down on the lounge in your
      room. Some of the neighbors were in just now chattering about the thing,
      and he slipped up there to keep from hearing what was said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fred found his employer stretched out at full length on a lounge in the
      big, light room which he had occupied for over two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Whipple said, &ldquo;it's you! Well, has anything turned up&mdash;I mean&mdash;but
      I know nothing has. Nothing can succeed against a gang of plotting,
      ungrateful dogs like they are. I've boosted 'em up through every panic and
      hard spell that come, keeping some of 'em afloat when they didn't have a
      dollar in their pockets, and now they not only knife me, but they make a
      public joke of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Whipple, I've been trying to think of some way to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you <i>have?</i> Well, spit it out!&mdash;spit it out!&rdquo; And the
      merchant suddenly threw his feet around and sat up, clutching the edge of
      the lounge with his big hands, while he stared anxiously from dilating
      eyes that were all but bloodshot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I hesitate to&mdash;&rdquo; Fred began modestly, but was interrupted
      by Whipple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hesitate!&mdash;hesitate the devil! It is always that way with you,
      although you've got the safest, soundest judgment of any young man in the
      West. You hesitated to tell me you thought San Antonio would be a good
      place to put an agent, and it has proved the biggest opening we ever had.
      You hesitated before advising me against that Eastern salt company that
      had been sucking my blood for years before you came and smelt out their
      thievery. You hesitated to&mdash;but, darn it, quit hesitating! This is no
      time to hesitate; we are in a dirty fight, and twenty yellow dogs are on
      top of us gnawing the meat from our bones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I've been thinking over it all, Mr. Whipple&mdash;&rdquo; Fred was
      slightly flushed&mdash;&ldquo;and there is only one way I can see to make any
      move at all; but that really does seem to <i>me</i> to offer <i>some</i>
      chance of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Move? What is it? For God's sake, what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you know you own the large retail store building which was vacated
      when Stimpson Brothers gave up, and you have not found a suitable tenant,
      there being no one but Thorp who wants it. It is in the very heart of the
      retail section, and the best-furnished building in town, with the best
      show-windows, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; but what of that?&rdquo; Whipple burst out, impatiently. &ldquo;I don't
      care a snap for the rent of a mere house when I am being literally choked
      to death by a mob of devils.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't that,&rdquo; Walton said; &ldquo;but there are hundreds of your personal
      friends in town who would gladly buy their home supplies from you if you
      would only accommodate them. There are many first-class wholesale houses
      which conduct retail stores in the towns they are in, and, you know, none
      of them ever had a better reason for doing it than you now have. It
      wouldn't hurt your trade out of town a bit, for your customers are not
      concerned in this fight; and a big, first-class, up-to-date retail store
      in the centre of town, supplied from our stock, would&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whipple sprang up. His eyes were dancing with delight. He leaned over
      Walton and put his hands on his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God, why didn't <i>I</i> think of that?&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;My boy, you
      are a dandy!&mdash;you are a wheel-horse! It will work like a charm. The
      thing advertises itself. We'll make 'em quake in their socks. They will
      laugh on the other sides of their faces now. And the beauty of it is, we
      can flaunt the thing on the public ten days before they can receive their
      first shipment; we'll bill the town in the morning, and cover the front of
      the new store with black letters. Whoopee! whoopee!&rdquo; And in his heavy
      boots old Whipple actually executed a clumsy clog-dance. &ldquo;And we'll let
      Dick manage it,&rdquo; he went on, as he paused panting. &ldquo;That sort of promotion
      would be a feather in his cap. As for you, you've got to pilot the <i>big</i>
      ship, my boy. A head like yours needs big things to deal with. Lord, I see
      Thorp's face now, and, as for that other gang of cutthroats, they will
      actually die of dry rot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whipple gave another whoop, and shuffled his feet thunderously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter up there?&rdquo; It was Mrs. Whipple's astonished voice from
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matter nothing!&rdquo; her husband replied, as he leaned over the balustrade in
      the corridor and looked down. &ldquo;Put the best supper you can rake up on the
      table. Kill the fatted calf, and don the royal purple! Me and this boy is
      going to celebrate. He has saved the ship! Get out a bottle of that grape
      wine, and let joy be unconfined. We're in the fight to stay now, and we're
      going to have a feast&mdash;a regular war-feast!&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>BOUT ten days
      after the happenings recorded in the foregoing chapter old Simon Walton
      sat alone in his office. A typewriter was clicking in the counting-room
      adjoining, its sound deadened by the closed door and thin partition
      through which it passed. With noiseless tread Toby Lassiter, now older,
      more careworn, more machine-like than ever, entered and laid a bulky
      express envelope before his employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; the banker asked, as he examined the heavy wax seals and
      reached for his paper-knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, sir; it came just now,&rdquo; and Toby silently withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walton clipped the twine, pried under the seals, and tore open the thick
      paper. It contained money. Six five-hundred-dollar bills were drawn out
      and laid on the desk. Wondering what it meant, the old man looked into the
      envelope. There was a letter, and it covered several pages of paper. A
      glance at the writing caused him a dull thrill of surprise. There was no
      address from which it was written, and it bore no date. It ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear Father,&mdash;I am sure you will be surprised to hear from me. I
      would have written before this if it could have done either of us any
      good. As I wrote you when I left, I had determined to turn over a new
      leaf, if such a thing were possible. It was an awful fight against big
      odds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, however, I happened to meet&mdash;and it was when I had almost
      given up&mdash;a rich man with a good heart who befriended me, and offered
      me a position in his big wholesale store. I had a struggle with myself as
      to what I ought to do in regard to revealing my past life, but I finally
      decided to tell him the truth, and I am glad to say he overlooked it all
      and became my friend and benefactor. I never knew it, when I was a wild,
      headstrong boy, bent on ruining myself and you, but I now realize that
      every growing soul needs some sort of incentive to endeavor, and I have
      found two which have helped me a lot. The first was to refund by honest
      earnings what I took from you, the next to prove my worthiness of the
      trust my employer placed in me when all hope was lost. I see now that I
      never could have overcome my bad habits if I had stayed on in Stafford. It
      was getting out into the world and learning what it means to fight
      adversity, with no one to lean on, that helped me. When I think over what
      you, yourself, had to go through with to get your start in life, and
      remember that I was deliberately throwing away the hard-won rewards of
      your efforts, the blood of shame fairly boils in my veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sending herewith three thousand dollars, which are my savings up to
      date. I had got together only twenty-five hundred, but when my employer,
      at my suggestion, succeeded in putting a certain deal through the other
      day which he considered advantageous to his interests, he insisted on
      adding five hundred dollars to the amount which I had told him was going
      to you. I am sending the money by express instead of by draft on any bank,
      for I would still prefer for you not to know where I am at present. When I
      have made the last payment on my debt (if you will let me call it that), I
      may feel differently, but until I am able to clear it all up I shall still
      hide from you and everybody who knew me in the past. I do hope you will
      read these lines kindly. I have wronged you (terribly wronged you), dear
      father, but I am trying now to live right, and surely you will be glad to
      know that, even at this late day. Concealing my whereabouts may anger you,
      I am well aware of that; but the good man for whom I am working thinks it
      is best&mdash;for a while, at any rate. Of course, if I could have a talk
      with you, I'd know better how you look at the matter, but being so far
      away leaves me no alternative than to let things remain as they are.
      Good-bye, dear father. It has taken six years to get together the money I
      am sending, but if I live and keep my health I feel reasonably sure that I
      can send the balance, including the interest, within the next two years,
      for I am doing much better than I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished reading the letter, Simon Walton laid it on the desk
      before him and sat in deep thought for several minutes. Then, with no
      visible trace of emotion on his wrinkled face, he took the money in his
      hands, laid it on the letter, and rose and went to the door opening into
      the counting-room. He stood looking at the workers for several minutes,
      and then, happening to catch the glance of Toby, who was dictating to a
      stenographer, he signalled him to approach. Handing him the letter and the
      bills, he said, curtly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Credit the money on my private account, then read that letter carefully
      and bring it back to me. Don't let anybody see it. It's private.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; said the clerk. &ldquo;I was just dictating a note to Morton
      &amp; Co., telling them that we can't possibly extend&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind about that <i>now</i>,&rdquo; Walton ordered, sharply. &ldquo;Do as I tell
      you!&rdquo; And he turned back into his office, where he sat slowly nodding his
      great, shaggy head, as was his habit when making up his mind over any
      matter of importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he said, suddenly and with a sneer, &ldquo;that's it! I can see through a
      millstone if it has a big enough hole in it. Huh, yes, that's it! I'd bet
      a yearling calf to a pound of butter that I am onto the game, and it is
      one, too, that would take in nine men out of ten.&rdquo; He tapped his brow with
      his pencil and smiled craftily. &ldquo;Deep scheme; good scheme; bang-up idea!
      Might have pulled the wool over my eyes <i>once</i>. But a burnt child
      dreads the fire, and I've certainly been burnt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door creaked. Toby Lassiter, with the letter quivering in his excited
      hand, approached. His lethargic face was filled with emotion; his mild
      eyes were glowing ecstatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always thought&mdash;I mean I always <i>hoped</i>, Mr. Walton&mdash;that
      it would turn out this way.&rdquo; He started to say more, but checked himself
      as his glance fell on the parchment-like face craftily upturned to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know, Toby!&rdquo; Simon snarled, as he took the letter and put it into
      his desk drawer. &ldquo;You always thought the scamp had sprouting wings, and
      now you are sure they are full size. That is why you have never risen
      higher in life, Toby. Your eyes are too easily closed. Leave it to you,
      and we'd never foreclose a mortgage on a widow with a full stocking hid
      away under her hearth. Believing in heaven on earth has held many a man
      back from prosperity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don't think&mdash;you don't actually believe that Fred&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set down in that chair, Toby. Me and you are the only folks in Stafford
      that know how that boy buncoed me, and I reckon it's only natural for me
      to be willing to talk about it when there is anything to say. I endured
      several years of that fellow's devilment, and I'm not calculated to be
      fooled as easily as others might who never had him on their hands. You
      see,&rdquo; the banker went on, as his clerk lowered his thin person timidly
      into a chair and leaned forward&mdash;&ldquo;you will note that he writes that
      he's got a good, substantial job with a rich man, who, while he knows all
      about the boy's devilment here at Stafford, has completely overlooked it.
      Huh! we all know the world is full of men of capital who are ready to take
      in a runaway thief and hand over three thousand cool plunks to him just to
      show good-will and the like! To begin with, Toby, <i>that</i> is an
      underhanded slap at me; it is saying, in a roundabout way, that a plumb
      stranger is giving a son of mine a chance that he never had at home. But
      the tale, from start to finish, is a lie out of whole cloth, as I have
      good and private reason to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so, Mr. Walton?&rdquo; Lassiter's fallen countenance sank even
      lower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I think so, or I wouldn't be sitting here telling you about it.
      I haven't been idle on this thing, Toby, though I never let anybody know
      what I was up to. You see, I am an old man now, and in law I never had but
      one heir to my effects, outside of my present wife, and it struck me as
      pretty queer for that heir, disinherited on paper or not, to keep
      absolutely out of sight and sound all these years when as big a plum as I
      am supposed to be is still aboveground. You see, the scamp has got what
      some folks would call a 'natural expectancy,' even on the chance of
      breaking any will I might make, and you can bet there are plenty of men
      slick enough to speculate on such chances, slim as they might look to me
      or you. So you see, Toby, knowing all that, I kept a sharp lookout for
      developments. I decided first of all to keep a watch on the young woman he
      left high and dry and in such a miserable plight. I used to sort o'
      saunter by her mammy's house once in a while. Sometimes I'd catch a
      glimpse of the girl by accident, but she kept as well hid as any mole that
      ever burrowed in the ground. Sometimes I'd see her&mdash;when she was to
      be seen at all&mdash;daubing away at some picture or other on a peaked
      frame, and I must say that every time I'd see her looking so neat and
      pretty, with her fine head of hair flowing over her brow in that easy,
      fluffy sort of way, and them big, deep, babyish eyes of hers&mdash;well,
      to come to the point, I began to think that it wasn't quite natural for <i>any</i>
      fellow to go clean off and leave such a creature behind for good and all.
      You see, she's too good-looking, too attractive, for any man to drop once
      he was favored, and&mdash;well, it made me suspicious, to say the least.
      Then I begun to notice the child, who was always hemmed up in that little
      pen of a yard, and never allowed to stick his head out or have any
      playmates. I saw that he was always rigged up as fine as a fiddle, looking
      as if he'd just come out of a bandbox; and as I knew, from personal
      knowledge, that the old lady had no income to speak of, except the rent on
      her barren little farm, I used to wonder where the cash was coming from.
      Now and then I'd see Watts &amp; Co.'s delivery wagon leaving groceries at
      the back door, and I found out through them, on the sly, that the grub
      bills was always paid. Then what do you think I did? I did some bang-up,
      fine detective work, if I <i>do</i> say it. I nosed around until I found
      out, through a clerk in the express office here, that packages of money
      were coming pretty regularly to the sly little lassie from somebody in
      Atlanta who called himself 'F. B. Jenkins.' Whoever it was, was using the
      express to hide his tracks, instead of sending bank-checks, which might
      come to my attention, as Fred well knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you think, Mr. Walton&mdash;you think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Fred's letter is a lie out of whole cloth,&rdquo; old Simon blurted
      out. &ldquo;I don't think he is at work; I don't think it was ever <i>in</i> him
      to work in any capacity; but I <i>do</i> believe he has set out to make
      good that shortage for a deep-laid reason. Some sharper or money-shark may
      be backing him, or he may have had a temporary streak of luck at poker or
      cotton futures, and has decided to invest something in me, as too big a
      fish to remain unhooked. I don't swallow one word of his mealymouthed
      tale. I'd bet my last dollar he's this F. B. Jenkins, and that he has been
      hanging around Atlanta all these years, keeping himself out of sight, and,
      like as not, coming here now and then under cover of night to see that
      woman. That's why she has kept so close at home. They have guarded the
      child, too, so that he wouldn't let the cat out of the bag. Toby, if I
      wanted to&mdash;if I just <i>wanted</i> to&mdash;I could put a watch on
      that cottage and nab our man in less than a month. I say, if I just <i>wanted</i>
      to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you wouldn't arrest him, Mr. Walton?&rdquo; Lassiter breathed, in relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not now, at any rate,&rdquo; Walton said, grimly. &ldquo;We are too solid in
      every way now for such a thing to do us any great financial damage, but I
      don't fancy the idea of stirring up the stench again. He has put in a
      pretty big amount to start with, and he won't lie idle after that. Mark my
      words, we'll hear from Atlanta, and it will be apt to come through the
      fellow that calls himself F. B. Jenkins.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>H, here you are,
      you old agnostic!&rdquo; Wynn Dearing called out jovially to Galt, one afternoon
      when he found the railroad president walking to and fro on the veranda of
      the latter's home. &ldquo;If you say so, we'll go in the house, and I'll make
      that examination here and save you the trouble of coming down to my pigpen
      of an office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could do it here, then?&rdquo; said Galt, a weary look on his pale face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easy enough; I've got my stethoscope in this satchel. I've just been
      across the street to see a negro with a whiskey liver. He is a goner, I
      guess, but I have more hopes of you. Your trouble may be found in those
      cigar boxes your railroad friends are sending you. If it is that, I'll cut
      you down to one a day, and smoke the rest myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had gone into the big library, the walls of which were hung with
      family portraits in oil, and lined with long, low cases filled with Galt's
      favorite books.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the big chair,&rdquo; Dearing said, &ldquo;and open your shirt in front.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galt tossed his half-smoked cigar through an open window and complied. The
      examination was made, and questions in regard to diet and habits were
      asked and answered. Dearing said nothing as he put his instrument into the
      satchel and closed it. He stood over his patient, eying him critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks to me like you are fundamentally as sound as a dollar,&rdquo; he said,
      his fine brow furrowed, &ldquo;but your case puzzles me a lot. To be frank, you
      are entirely too thin, your cheeks are sunken, your skin is dry, and your
      eye dull. You are very nervous, and are growing gray hairs as fast as
      crab-grass. Somehow, I don't think you need any sort of medicine. Now, if
      you were not absolutely the luckiest man in Georgia, I'd think you had
      something to worry about. Worry has killed more men than all the plagues
      on earth; but that can't be your trouble, for every good thing in life has
      come your way. You had a great ambition a few years ago, but you gratified
      it; surely you don't want to own any more railroads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, one is enough,&rdquo; Galt answered, with a faint, forced smile. &ldquo;I can't
      say that I am worrying over that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the condition of the minds of patients,&rdquo; said Dearing, &ldquo;is the
      biggest thing doctors have to tackle. We can hold our own with a disease
      of the body, because we can see it and, at least, experiment with it for
      good or bad; but when the seat of the thing is in a man's soul, and he
      won't uncover it, but keeps fooling himself and his doctor by looking for
      it under his hide or in his blood or bones, why, we are at a standstill. I
      had a patient once who certainly had me at my wit's end. He was sound as
      you are physically, but he was restless, dissatisfied, morbid, lonely, and
      utterly miserable. I exhausted every resource on him. I sent him to
      specialists all over America, but they were as helpless as I was. Finally,
      in sheer desperation, I took the bull by the horns and asked him if he had
      anything on his mind of a disagreeable nature. He hung his head, and I
      knew then that something was wrong. I pumped him adroitly, assuring him
      that all private matters were held in confidence by a physician, and he
      finally made a clean breast of it. He was a rich man, but every dollar he
      owned had been accumulated from money stolen from another man, and a man
      who had failed in life and died in abject poverty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I see!&rdquo; Galt sat more erect, his eyes fixed on Dearing's face. &ldquo;That
      was his trouble; and what did he do about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Died hugging the rotten thing to his breast,&rdquo; the doctor said; &ldquo;and that
      is the way with most of them. He couldn't face the music&mdash;he couldn't
      confess to the puny little world around him that he wasn't what it had
      always thought him. Perhaps he had gone too far to believe in the cure
      that God has made possible for every poor devil in toils of that sort.
      That's the trouble. Spirituality has to be practised to be a reality.
      Faith cures of all sorts have their place in the world, for a sick soul
      will certainly make a sick body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you believe in rubbish of that sort,&rdquo; Galt said, contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the extent I have indicated, yes,&rdquo; Dearing replied. &ldquo;I think I could
      demonstrate scientifically that health of body and faith in something
      higher than mere matter go hand in hand. Tell a weak man that his body is
      sound, and he will gain strength; convince a man that he is hopelessly
      old, and he will no longer be buoyed up by the hope of life. Show him his
      grave, and he will begin to measure himself for it. Therefore&mdash;and
      here is where I am going to hit you, you old atheist,&rdquo; Dearing continued,
      half jestingly&mdash;&ldquo;let a man constantly argue to himself that life ends
      here on earth, and he will wither away physically, as he already has
      spiritually; for what would be the incentive to live if death ends all? I
      meet all sorts of men and women, and the healthiest old codgers I run
      across are the old chaps who believe they are sanctified. They may be as
      close as the bark of a tree, absolutely proof against any sort of
      charitable impulse, but the belief of their immortality keeps them pink
      and rosy to their graves; half of them die only because they want a change
      of residence, and expect to own a corner lot on the golden streets of the
      New Jerusalem. The preachers teach us that we've got to go through a lot
      of red-tape to be saved, but I believe the time will come when immortality
      will be demonstrated as plainly as the fact that decayed matter will
      reproduce life in a plant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, life is too short to argue on these things,&rdquo; Galt said, wearily. &ldquo;You
      have always seen the thing one way, and I another. I am in good company.
      The greatest minds of the world have believed as I do. I can't say that I
      <i>want</i> to live forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I do&mdash;I do,&rdquo; returned Dearing. &ldquo;There was a time, thanks to my
      early association with you, by-the-way, when I doubted; but I always had a
      frightful pang at the thought that the wonderful mystery of life must
      continue to be a closed book to me. I fought it, Kenneth, old man&mdash;I
      fought that thought day and night, because my soul was so enamoured with
      the great secret that I could not give it up; and now&mdash;well, on my
      honor, the faith in it has become my very existence. Without that prospect
      I'd stop right here. I'd not care to move an inch. I'd as soon cut your
      throat as to treat you as a friend. But I didn't come to preach. What is
      that you've got stacked up on the table&mdash;drawings for another
      trunk-line?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Galt rose languidly and smiled. &ldquo;I'll show you something very
      pretty. You know I am fond of good pictures, and I flatter myself that I
      have discovered a genius. There is an art dealer, F. B. Jenkins, in
      Atlanta, whom I know pretty well, and he called me in the other day to
      show me some water-color pictures by a young girl, who, it seems, is too
      modest to allow her name to be used. Then, too, I think he regards her as
      his find, and doesn't want other dealers to know about her. I bought
      these.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galt opened a big portfolio, and began taking out the pictures one by one.
      &ldquo;Where has any one ever seen a child more lifelike than that one? Why, it
      is actually walking away from the paper; and look at that one on the
      fence, and this boy with the top and string!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, good gracious!&rdquo; Dearing cried out, impulsively, as he stood
      transfixed by surprise, &ldquo;I know who did that work&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; But he
      checked himself suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> know who did it?&rdquo; Galt said, facing him in surprise. &ldquo;What do
      you mean, Wynn. Do you really know anything about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spoke without thinking,&rdquo; Dearing said, awkwardly. &ldquo;You know, a
      physician sometimes runs across matters which he is obliged to regard as
      confidential, and, since the&mdash;the lady doesn't want to be known, I
      could not feel free to mention her name; besides, you know, I <i>might</i>
      be mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dearing turned from the pictures and moved toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am satisfied that you could tell more about it if you would,&rdquo; Galt
      said. &ldquo;I really would like to know, for I have never run across pictures I
      liked so well. And to think they are done by some young woman who may not
      know how good her work really is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing&mdash;absolutely nothing,&rdquo; Wynn said, with a non-committal
      smile. &ldquo;But, if I did, I wouldn't trust it to you or any other man, so
      there you are. Why haven't you been over? Uncle Tom and Madge look for you
      every afternoon to join them at tea. You'd better come soon; they are off
      for New York in a few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New York!&rdquo; Galt exclaimed, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you know they go up there every summer for a ten days' stay,
      visiting the Marstons. Old Marston was a colonel under my uncle in the
      war. He went to New York after peace was declared and invested all he had
      left. He is now a big tea-and-coffee importer, and worth a lot of money.
      Mrs. Marston likes Madge, and gives her a big time once a year. It is
      always a picnic for uncle and her. They start off like jolly
      school-children. They have the time of their lives from the moment they
      leave till they get back all tired out and coated with dust. Now, you look
      after your health, Kenneth. Lie around this quiet old house and take a
      good rest. Keep those bookcases with their lying contents closed, and read
      sound, hopeful literature, and I'll see that you stay above ground for a
      good many years to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could only get <i>you</i> to read those books, instead of the
      namby-pamby stuff issued by the Sunday-schools for the edification of
      children who still believe in Santa Claus, you'd be a wiser man,&rdquo; Galt
      said, good-naturedly, as he accompanied Dearing to the door. &ldquo;But, then,
      I'd not have the fun of arguing with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could put up as good an argument, even on your own side, as you can,&rdquo;
       Dearing said, half seriously. &ldquo;I could give one illustration which would
      prove to men like you, at least, that the whole world is topsy-turvy, and
      the Creator, if there is such a thing, more heartless than any man alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could? Well, that's interesting&mdash;coming from you, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was this,&rdquo; Dearing went on, now quite serious, as he stood facing
      Galt, swinging his satchel in his hand: &ldquo;As I came in just now I saw about
      thirty children&mdash;little boys and girls&mdash;over on Lewis Weston's
      lawn. They were all rigged out in their Sunday clothes and playing games,
      just as you and I did on the same spot when we were kids. It was little
      Grover Weston's birthday, and his daddy, being our Congressman, the
      undersized 'four hundred' were doing honors to the occasion. Even from
      where I stood I could see the toys, wagons, tricycles, and hobby-horses
      which had been presented to the little Georgia lord, and he was strutting
      about thoroughly enjoying the limelight that was on him. That was <i>one</i>
      side of the picture. The other side was this: Down at the lower end of our
      place stood a solitary little figure. Not one among them all could hold a
      candle to him in looks or brightness of mind. You know who I mean; it was
      the little chap you took a fancy to the other day when he jumped into your
      arms from that tree. There he stood, his bat and ball idle at his feet,
      watching every movement of the gay little crowd across the way. I couldn't
      know what his thoughts were, but, as I stood looking at him, I wondered
      what I should have thought at his age. Was his growing and supersensitive
      mind already struggling with the question of inequality? I remember that
      I, at his age, felt a slight keenly, and if <i>I</i> did, with my many
      advantages as a child, what must he feel? There is an argument for you,
      Kenneth. The next time you want to prove the utter heartlessness and
      aimlessness of God and His universe, just paint that picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galt made no response. His blood seemed to turn cold in his veins as the
      grimly accusing words fell from his friend's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is not the way I'm going to let the story end, in my fancy, at
      least,&rdquo; Dearing continued, after a pause. &ldquo;Kenneth, old chap, I see a
      silver lining peeping out from beneath even that poor child's cloud. I see
      the hidden hand of God following the father who deserted his duty to flee
      to some far-off hiding-place. I see that man hungering for spiritual rest;
      I see his very crime humbling and sweetening his soul and causing him to
      long for what he has left behind him. I see the fortune that avarice is
      piling up in his father's coffers being turned to good account. In short,
      I see that boy and his beautiful child-mother, who never had a fault but
      that of blindly trusting, taken away somewhere to ultimate happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think&mdash;you think&mdash;&rdquo; Galt stammered, unable to formulate an
      adequate reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the man does not live who could have been loved and trusted by
      Dora Barry and ever forget her. The man does not live who could be the
      father of <i>such</i> a child by <i>such</i> a mother&mdash;such as she
      has grown to be since her great misfortune&mdash;and not fight for her and
      her child with his last breath.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Dearing had
      gone blithely down the street, Galt strode up and down the veranda, hot
      and cold, by turns, with fury and remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think that any man could lecture me like that, while I have had to
      stand and take it like a sneaking coward!&rdquo; he fumed. &ldquo;I am not a jot worse
      than thousands of others who were led astray by passion. I had to do as I
      did. I couldn't give up what I had sought so long, and fought for so
      fiercely. She knew it; she admitted there was nothing else to do. All
      these years she has not once reproached me, and she has kept her word&mdash;the
      secret is ours. Wynn says she has advanced, that her solitary life has
      only ripened her beauty of mind and body, and she is the mother of my
      child&mdash;the little fellow I held in my arms the other day, the outcome
      of a marriage as sacred under high heaven as any ever solemnized at an
      altar.&rdquo; He groaned as he remembered how he and Dora used to boast that
      their superior mental attitude, and the height and glory of their troth,
      as compared to the dull code of the vulgar herd, had made them a law unto
      themselves. He had sown the seeds of such logic in the rich soil of her
      trusting, girlish inexperience. He had led her, as a candle leads a moth,
      on to the yawning brink of the abyss; he had closed her gentle mouth, even
      as it uttered words of love and fidelity, and then, by sheer brute force,
      he had flung her down to darkness and despair. That was the truth he had
      not fully allowed himself to face in those years of gratified ambition
      which had followed, and it was the truth that Wynn Dearing, with his
      maddening manliness, had hurled into his face to-day. And Dearing had
      argued that the end was not yet&mdash;that the earthly struggle wasn't all
      there was to man&mdash;that to eat, procreate, and live a certain span of
      years was not the solution of the problem of existence. How utterly
      absurd! And yet what was his present ailment? It was not of the body, as
      he had well known when Dearing was speaking of his condition; and since it
      was not so, what was it? What force known to science had kindled the
      raging fires within him, made him desire to shim his own kind, and hate
      the success which, like a hellish will-o'-the-wisp, had once blazed over
      him. There was nothing to do, of course, but to continue the fight on his
      own lines, by the light of the reason born in him. Of course, a man could
      be sad and gloomy over an old love affair if he continued to brood over it&mdash;if
      he continued to allow it to dominate him. Dora had accepted the
      inevitable, as any sensible woman would have done, and it was left for him
      to go on his way unmolested&mdash;free! General Sylvester wanted him to
      marry his niece; she was his social equal, and in time would be as well
      off in point of fortune. She was a beautiful, imposing, gracious woman,
      and would make a wife any man would be proud of. Yes, his duty to himself
      was clear, and dreams like young Dearing indulged in would have to be
      banished for ever and ever. Yes, he would marry Margaret Dearing, and he
      and she would travel the world over. He was ready to resign the active
      management of the big enterprise he had created, and he would be free in
      every sense. Yes, he would be free&mdash;just as other men were free.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had stepped down on the grass of the lawn and strolled round the house.
      Shouts and peals of childish laughter came from the yard adjoining his on
      the left, and on the grass, engaged in a joyous game of hide-and-seek,
      twoscore boys and girls ran merrily about. Galt walked farther down toward
      the lower boundary of his premises, seeking with his eyes an object he
      would not have confessed to himself that he desired to see&mdash;the child
      Dearing had mentioned. Now he saw the boy, but he was not within the
      Dearing grounds; Lionel had crossed over to Galt's land, and stood
      shielded from the view of the merrymakers by a hedge of boxwood. Galt saw
      him peering cautiously over the hedge, now stealthily lowering his head,
      now eagerly raising it. He was neatly dressed in white, as when his father
      had first seen him; there was a jaunty grace about the flowing necktie and
      low, broad collar which could have been accounted for only by the taste of
      an artistic mother. He held his broad-brimmed straw hat in his hand, and
      the breeze swept his tresses back from his fine brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why he did it Galt could not have explained, especially on top of the
      resolutions just formed, but he went down to him. Lionel's face was
      averted, and he was not aware of his father's approach till his attention
      was attracted by Galt's step on the grass. Then he started, flushed, and
      with alarm written in his face he made a movement as if to run away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you are not afraid of <i>me?</i>&rdquo; Galt said, reassuringly, and in
      a tone which, for its unwonted gentleness, was a surprise to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no right to be on your land,&rdquo; the boy faltered, his great,
      startled eyes downcast. &ldquo;Doctor Wynn said I must never leave his place.
      But there wasn't any fence, and I&mdash;I saw the children playing over
      there, and I wanted to get a little closer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you needn't be afraid; you have done no wrong,&rdquo; Galt heard himself
      saying, as undefined pangs and twinges shot through him. &ldquo;You may come
      here whenever you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, may I? Thank you. You are very good, and I thought you'd be angry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angry? How absurd! What in the world could cause you to think I could be
      angry with a harmless little chap like you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know; but I did. I was sure at first that you liked me. You know
      the day I almost went to sleep in your lap, when the pretty lady and the
      old gentleman were at the tea-table? Well, I <i>did</i> think you liked me
      then, at first, you know, but when the doctor came and said it was late
      for children to be out, you put me down quick, and got red in the face,
      and never looked at me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a rustic bench near by, and Galt sat down on it. He found
      himself unable to formulate a satisfactory reply, and he was going to let
      the remark pass unnoticed, but Lionel came forward now more confidently,
      and sat on the end of the bench. A thrill akin to that which he had felt
      when he discovered the identity of the child passed over Galt. There was
      an indescribable something in the boy's great eyes so like his mother's,
      in the artistic slenderness of his hands, in his exquisite profile, that
      dug deep into the soul of the man who sat there self-convicted of the
      crime of wilful desertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm sure something was wrong that day,&rdquo; Lionel said, tentatively. &ldquo;I
      can always 'tell when mamma is angry at me, and I knew you were, for you
      didn't say good-bye. The others didn't, either, but I didn't care for
      them. I like Doctor Wynn, and I like you, but that is all, except Granny
      and my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like me, and why?&rdquo; Galt questioned, almost under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't know, but I do. I did when I first saw you looking up at me
      in that tree, and then when you held me in your lap. I wanted to go to
      sleep there, it felt so good&mdash;your arms are so fine and strong.
      Doctor Wynn says your father was a great soldier, and that you have his
      sword and a picture of him. Oh, I should love to see them! I'd like to be
      a soldier. Some day, if I am a good boy, will you let me see the sword?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, you may come&mdash;<i>now</i>, if you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are joking, aren't you?&rdquo; Lionel asked, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm in earnest. Come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, do you mean it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course. Come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They started toward the house side by side. Suddenly Lionel remarked,
      timidly, &ldquo;You haven't said you like me yet, but I suppose you do, or you
      wouldn't let me go with you in your house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I like you&mdash;of course I do,&rdquo; Galt answered, lamely and abashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very, very much, or just a little&mdash;which is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As much as any boy I ever met; there, will that do you, little man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you met many? That's the question,&rdquo; the boy laughed out,
      impulsively, and then his face settled into gravity as he eagerly waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a great many,&rdquo; Galt answered, as he wondered over the child's
      peculiar persistency. Dearing had said he was supersensitive. Could the
      trait be an unremovable birth-mark of the mother's unhappiness when
      overwhelmed with the sense of utter desertion? If so, then there was
      physical proof of the Biblical statement that the sins of fathers were
      visited on their children. Galt shuddered and avoided the appealing face
      upturned to his. Again he heard the musical voice, so like an echo out of
      the dreamy, accusing past, rising to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you did like me, it looks like you would take my hand. I wish you
      would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; Galt forced a laugh as he took the soft, pulsating little fingers
      into his. As flesh touched flesh a thrill as of new life throbbed and
      bounded through him, and again he had the yearning to clasp his son to his
      breast as a woman would have done. As it was, no lover could have felt the
      touch of the hand of his mistress with keener, more awed delight. At one
      time, in a talk with Bearing, Galt had argued that even parental love was
      merely a physical function, like hunger for food, but that had been before
      this perplexing awakening. They had reached the front steps of the great
      house. An impulse he could not have analyzed led Galt to think of lifting
      the boy from the ground to the floor of the veranda, and he held out his
      arms. The child Sprang into them; his little arm went round the man's
      neck, and thus the steps were ascended. Was it a lingering pressure of
      affection in Lionel's arm that kept Galt from lowering him to the carpet
      when they had entered the great hall? He was sure he would put him down as
      they entered the library, but again he refrained, for the magnitude and
      splendor of the room had actually startled the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Lionel exclaimed, his eyes first on the great crystal chandelier,
      then on the gilt-framed pier-glass reaching from the floor to the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what is the matter?&rdquo; Galt asked, holding him tighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know it was so beautiful, so grand!&rdquo; Lionel cried. &ldquo;This room
      alone is as large as our whole house. Ah! is that the sword your father
      killed men with? And will you please let me see it? Could I hold it, just
      once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid it is too heavy for you,&rdquo; Galt said, as he reached for the
      heavy sabre in its carved brass scabbard and took it down from a hook
      under his father's portrait. &ldquo;It wasn't made for little hands like yours.
      You'd have to grow a lot before you could use it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lionel stood down on the floor as the sword was put into his hands. He
      made a valiant effort to flourish the unwieldy blade as he thrust and
      lunged at an imaginary enemy. &ldquo;Boom! Boom!&rdquo; he cried, his eyes flashing,
      &ldquo;Boom! t-r-r-r boom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you've killed them&mdash;they are as dead as doornails!&rdquo; Galt
      laughed, impulsively. &ldquo;Now your men will have a pretty time picking all
      those corpses up in an ambulance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your father?&rdquo; the boy leaned on the sabre to ask, as he looked up
      at the portrait of the elder Galt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Does he look like me?&rdquo; Galt answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little bit, maybe&rdquo;&mdash;the child had his wise-looking head tilted to
      one side as he had seen his mother stand in criticising one of her
      pictures&mdash;&ldquo;but I don't like it much. It is full of cracks, and so&mdash;dauby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'<i>Dauby</i>'? Where in the world could you have heard that word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my mother says it often when she doesn't like one of her pictures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child was now absorbed in the bronze dragon head supporting the ivory
      handle of the sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see; perhaps you'd like pictures of children better,&rdquo; Galt said, and he
      took up one of the water-color sketches he had shown to Dearing. &ldquo;Here,
      look at this little boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, that's me! Mamma says it is hard to keep them from all looking
      alike. Sometimes I'm a boy&mdash;then I'm a girl, and even a baby&mdash;but
      they are all me. Mamma says I'm her bread and butter. But I don't like to
      sit for them; it is too tiresome to stay still so long. Sometimes she lets
      me play in the yard, and watches me through the window; then I don't mind
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say&rdquo;&mdash;Galt was grave, and his hands trembled as he
      picked up another picture, this time the sketch of a boy riding on a
      spring-board supported in the middle by a saw-horse, and fastened at the
      end to a crude rail-fence&mdash;&ldquo;do you mean that your mother really
      painted this?&rdquo; And as he spoke Galt recalled Dearing's evident recognition
      of the work, and his prompt reservation in regard to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and stacks and stacks of others,&rdquo; the child said, abstractedly, his
      little fingers toying with the handle of the sword again. &ldquo;Is it sharp
      enough to cut a man's head off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo; Galt sat down in a chair, his mind now full of startled
      memories&mdash;Dora's wonderful artistic taste, her early love of music,
      books on art, and the drawings which she had spoken of timidly, but never
      shown him. And this was her work&mdash;the pictures he had seen groups of
      people admiring, as they hung in the shop-window in Atlanta&mdash;and
      which he knew was the work of actual creative genius. And it had come from
      the spirit he had crushed, exiled from humanity, and left destitute! His
      ambition had won its sordid goal through the darkness of damnation, while
      hers&mdash;unconscious of its own deity&mdash;was growing toward the outer
      light, like a flower in a dungeon. And this was his child and hers!
      Compounded in the winsome personality of the boy was all that was good and
      noble of her, all that was bad and despicable of him, and Dearing would
      say that it was not going to end with the temporary breath which had been
      blown into the little form. The child was to live on and perpetuate the
      qualities he had inherited. He was like a little God now, in the likeness
      of the child-mother who had borne him, but 'the time might come when he
      would take on to himself the cringing, soul-lashed features of his father&mdash;be
      guilty of the same crimes against virtue and eternal justice, and fight
      the same cruel battle between spirit and flesh, between the forces of
      light and darkness. God forbid! &ldquo;God!&rdquo;&mdash;had he actually used the
      word? Was there such a Being? He had sneered at the thought all his life,
      but now the bare possibility cowed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lionel, astride the sheathed sword, now half boy, half prancing steed,
      came to him. &ldquo;Whoa! Can't you stand still, sir? Watch him kick up! Look
      out!&rdquo; as he pirouetted about, &ldquo;he'll get you with his hind heels! He wants
      to run; something has scared him! Look how he's trembling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galt laid his hand on the sunny curls, and drew the excited little
      horseman to him, gazing into the dreamy, fathomless eyes so accusingly
      like Dora's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I'd better hold you both,&rdquo; he said, in an attempt at playfulness.
      He had heard sordid business men who had children say that there was no
      love like that of a man for an eldest son. This was his eldest son, if not
      by the writs of man, by the mandates of something infinitely higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had a really-really horse,&rdquo; Lionel ran on, plaintively. &ldquo;Grover
      Weston has a pony, but mamma says he can have everything because his
      father is rich. I don't like him. He threw my ball back over the fence the
      other day and called me names. I don't know what he meant by them, but my
      mother said they were not nice, and told me not to remember them. I've
      already forgot what he said. It was bas&mdash;bast&mdash;How funny! I knew
      it once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galt's inner being seemed to shrink and wither. Already the world's
      persecution of the innocent had begun, and the sensitive, poetic,
      imaginative child would grow up to a full realization of his social shame.
      Nurtured in gentleness and refinement, he was yet to have the scales which
      hid his humiliation from from his sight, and then he would see; he would
      understand; he would know who to blame. And he <i>would</i> blame,
      poignantly and justly. The time might come when this tender sprig of
      himself, grown strong, and yet galled by his burden, might face his father
      as the cowardly churl who had stamped the unbearable stigma upon him and
      her. This child might live to curse him and spit upon him. The world might
      forgive in the glow of his power and gold, but the one he yearned for now,
      as he had yearned for nothing before, would go over his infamous past as
      minutely as an ant over the bark of a rotten tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child had put down the weapon of his honored ancestor, and now stood
      with his little hands on the knee of his father, another side of his
      personality uppermost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care,&rdquo; he said, in his charmingly premature way, &ldquo;if Grover
      Weston <i>doesn't</i> like me, because you say you do. He's nothing but a
      mean, horrid boy, while you are&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am what, Lionel?&rdquo; Galt's voice was stayed by huskiness in his throat,
      and he put an unsteady arm round the little form, resisting the yearning
      to clasp him tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are everything&mdash;everything in the world. Doctor Wynn says
      you are very, very rich, and that you love all little boys&mdash;that's
      why I jumped that day. I wouldn't be afraid to jump from a higher tree
      than that if you were there to catch me. Oh, I like to have people love
      me! I like it better than anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you <i>do</i> want other things?&rdquo; Galt said, tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes.&rdquo; The child, guided by the gentle pressure round him, slid between
      his father's knees, and, putting his arm confidingly about Galt's neck, he
      drew himself to a seat in the man's lap, and laughed. &ldquo;Mamma says I want
      the whole earth. I want a bicycle; and a gun; and a pony; and
      roller-skates; and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly do want a <i>few</i> things!&rdquo; Galt tried to jest. &ldquo;But we
      can't have everything, you know, in this life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless we are rich; and we are very poor at our house; but when the
      expressman brings the money for the pictures we are very glad. Then we
      have a good dinner. Last time Granny got a dress, and I got several suits
      like this one. Mother says some day we may go away off to another country
      where I'll have children to play with. I think that would be nicer than
      having toys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Galt responded, from the depths of a new and rasping remorse,
      as the boy reclined on his arm and stretched out with a delicious sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you liked me,&rdquo; the child said, quite seriously, &ldquo;but you never
      have kissed me&mdash;not once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But men don't kiss little boys,&rdquo; Galt answered, with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes they do; Doctor Wynn has often kissed me, and hugged me, so!&rdquo;
       Lionel put his arms round Galt's neck, pressed his soft, warm cheek
      against the cold, rough one, and kissed it, once, twice, three times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I've seen Mr. Weston kiss Grover when he runs to meet him at the
      gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've known each other such a short time,&rdquo; Galt apologized, lamely, as
      the hot blood coursed through his veins, and the child released him and
      lay staring at him from his great, reproachful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care, you'd kiss me if you loved me as&mdash;as much as I do you.
      Won't you, just one time? Then I'll go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'll kiss you&mdash;there!&rdquo; Galt said, as he folded the child in his
      arms and pressed his lips to the warm, pink brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to make you!&rdquo; Lionel said, as he stood down on the floor. &ldquo;That is
      the way I do when my mother is angry. I keep begging her to kiss me till
      she does; then she laughs and hugs me tighter than ever. Granny says I
      know how to manage a woman. Good-bye. I thank you for bringing me to your
      house. Now I am sure you like little boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the child had gone, Galt walked up and down the veranda, his mind
      upon problems he had never faced before. He was interrupted by General
      Sylvester, who hurried across the lawn to speak to him on his way
      down-town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've only a bare minute,&rdquo; the old gentleman said. &ldquo;I suppose you know we
      are off for New York. You'd better come along and help us have a good
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid Wynn would hardly prescribe a remedy so strenuous as that in
      my case,&rdquo; Galt returned. &ldquo;You see, I was tied down there recently, and got
      enough of it for a man who is said to need quiet and a change of scene.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's true,&rdquo; Sylvester admitted. &ldquo;It was only because we'd like to have
      you so much that I mentioned it. But we'll take you in hand when we get
      back. So you be ready, young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the old gentleman had walked away, with his springy, boyish step, and
      the gate-latch had clicked behind him, Galt went back into the library. He
      gathered up Dora's pictures with reverent hands, and took them up to his
      bedroom. He arranged them in good positions, and stood looking at them
      steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she's in them all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Her weeping soul speaks out from every
      one. She has done those things in spite of the disgrace and misery that my
      cowardice has heaped upon her. What must she think of me&mdash;of me, whom
      she once placed upon such a pinnacle? Her own purity created the place for
      me in her heart which I once held, and from which her contempt has long
      since banished me. I've lost her. I owe her the world, and can pay her
      nothing&mdash;absolutely nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His attention was attracted to the children on Weston's lawn. They were
      loudly laughing, shouting, and singing. He went to the window and looked
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'King William was King James's son,'&rdquo; they sang, as hand in hand they
      circled round on the grass. Galt's eyes rested only momentarily on the
      players. He was searching for some one else. Finally he espied the object
      of his quest. Lionel&mdash;his son, a full-blooded Galt, and, for aught he
      knew, the flower of the race&mdash;was hidden behind a tree peering out
      like a half-starved urchin at a window filled with sweets. He stood erect
      and motionless, as if hardly daring to breathe lest he be seen by his
      social superiors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is waking!&rdquo; Galt exclaimed. &ldquo;He is wondering and pondering. The time
      will come when he will understand and remember, perhaps, that I kissed him
      with the lips of Judas&mdash;I, who should have been his mainstay and
      supporter&mdash;kissed him as he lay in my arms, conscious of my love and
      ignorant of my weakness. No, I can't help him. Drawn to him as I am by
      every fibre of my being, still I must deny him. The man does not live who,
      in the same circumstances, could act otherwise. I haven't the moral
      backbone. I simply haven't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the window, and sinking into a chair, Galt bent forward, locked
      his cold hands together, and wrung them as a man might in the agony of
      death.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>VERYTHING is as
      merry as a marriage bell, and the goose hangs high!&rdquo; Stephen Whipple
      quoted, with a hearty laugh, as he and Fred Walton sat on the old man's
      veranda after breakfast one Sunday morning. &ldquo;And I'm a-thinking, my boy,
      that the suspended fowl is none other than our fellow citizen, J. B.
      Thorp. He is as mad as a wet hen. He had us plumb down, and, like the
      bully he is, was pounding the blood out of us with no thought of letting
      up. Then the rest of the hungry pack of wolves piled on top, and began to
      get in their work. I was so crazy I didn't know my hat from a hole in the
      ground. Then your keen young brain turned the trick, and here we are. Dick
      has got the dandiest retail store that ever saw the light in a Western
      town, and it is literally packed and jammed with customers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am certainly glad it turned out as it did,&rdquo; Fred replied. &ldquo;It has been
      a great thing for Dick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The merchant was silent for a moment, and Fred saw him twirling his heavy
      thumbs as he often did when embarrassed. Finally, after clearing his
      throat and rather awkwardly crossing his legs, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got a silly sort of confession to make, Fred. I reckon nobody is, on
      the outside, exactly what they are within, and I've got my faults like
      other fellows. On the outside I'm as strait-laced as a hard-shell Baptist,
      but I've always hankered after a periodical lark of some sort. Once in a
      great while I've taken trips just for the pure fun' of the thing. During
      the Centennial at Philadelphia I laid down everything and went. I stayed a
      week, put up at a fine hotel, and lived as high as I knew how. I saw all
      that there was to see. Then I struck work at one time and went to the
      Mardi-gras at New Orleans, and then another time I hiked off to the Cotton
      Exposition in Atlanta. I don't know why I'm that way, but I am. It is my
      periodical spree, I reckon. You remember I told you about my boy&mdash;the
      little fellow that passed away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember,&rdquo; Walton returned, sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as he was growing up, I used to love, above all things, for just me
      and him&mdash;just me and him, you know&mdash;to go to places together.
      Sometimes it was a ride in the country, or fishing, or to do something a
      little boy would like, but I always sort o' kept the thought before me
      that when he'd reached man's estate, me and him would do some sure-enough
      'bumming,' as I used to call it&mdash;bumming to New York City, where we
      could take in all the sights like two boys. It may sound silly, but that
      was one thing I always had to look forward to; but then he took sick and
      died, and it was out of the question. Since then I've never counted on the
      New York trip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was sad,&rdquo; Walton said, gently. &ldquo;It is a pity he couldn't have been
      spared to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but he wasn't,&rdquo; the merchant sighed. &ldquo;He wasn't, and this is what I
      started out to say: Of all folks I have ever known since my boy's death,
      you come nearer filling his place than any one else. No&rdquo;&mdash;and Whipple
      held up his broad hand&mdash;&ldquo;don't stop me! I don't know how it was, but
      in our first talk that night you kind o' got hold of my heart-strings. I
      pitied you as I had never pitied a young fellow before because of the
      fight you were making. I got interested in it, and determined to help you
      win. I prayed for you. You were on my mind the last thing at night and the
      first thing in the morning. You'd said you wanted the money just to pay
      off the debt you owed your father, and I would have planked the cash right
      down many and many a time if I hadn't been afraid I'd spoil a thing that
      seemed to be of God's own making. I used to sneak and look at your
      bank-account. That was mean, but I couldn't help it. I saw your savings
      piling up week after week until I forced that five hundred on you, and
      knew you had three thousand in hand. Then, all at once, it sunk to
      nothing. Fred, my boy, I went home that night, hugged the old lady, and
      cried. You needn't tell me what became of that money. It went to your old
      daddy as fast as the trains could take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I paid him, Mr. Whipple. I am still behind two thousand, with the
      interest at the rate he charges his customers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a money-lender then?&rdquo; Whipple said, lifting his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he&mdash;&rdquo; Fred hesitated a moment, and then finished, &ldquo;He is a
      banker, in a small town in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't&mdash;don't tell me!&rdquo; Whipple broke in. &ldquo;Don't tell me a thing
      about him! I'm human to the core. I don't know why it is, but for a long
      time I have been jealous of his blood claim on you. He throwed you off,
      and I want to think that I have some sort of right to you. He never loved
      you as a natural father should, or he couldn't have driven you to the wall
      like he did, forcing you to live off among strangers, away from home-ties
      and all the associations of your young days. Oh, I know I have your
      good-will, my boy! I heard about the way you stood up for me during the
      strike my men tried to get up. One of the clerks told me of the
      nightmeeting that was held, and how you sprang into their midst like an
      infuriated tiger, and of the ringing speech you made about me and my fair
      treatment of them, and how they finally begged you not to report the
      matter and slunk away like egg-sucking dogs. You never would have
      mentioned it, but it got to me&mdash;it got to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I only did my duty, Mr. Whipple.&rdquo; Fred's face was dyed red. &ldquo;I
      thought they were unreasonable, and could not help putting in a word of
      protest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were the only one in the entire bunch that did it, all the same,&rdquo;
       Whipple said, huskily. &ldquo;Oh, I know they poke fun at me and laugh at my
      peculiarities, but I don't believe you ever did. I am coarse and awkward&mdash;I
      don't have to be told that; but I try to be genuine and fair to all
      mankind. But I've got away off from what I started to say. Fred, there
      never was a time when I felt more like one of my periodical sprees than
      right now. I have never been to New York, and I can't get over wanting to
      take it in. My wife don't care to go. She says such trips tire the very
      life out of her. She is younger than I am in years, but she ain't in
      spirit. I want you to lay off work for a week and go bumming with me.
      Somehow, I feel like if you'll go, it will be as if my own boy had lived
      and grown up and was taking the trip with me. I want to go by New Orleans
      and spend a day there, and then on to the East, through Georgia,
      Tennessee, and Virginia. What do you say, Fred? The expense is nothing. I
      want to celebrate. For a week I want to be a new man, and have a high old
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like it very much,&rdquo; Walton said, &ldquo;if you really want me to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, pack your grip, and we'll be off day after tomorrow. We'll tell the
      boys that we have to see our New York importers and our sugar men in New
      Orleans, and they can guess the rest. Now, I'm going up to tell the old
      lady that it is settled, and she can sleep or do any other old thing she
      likes till, we come back. We'll have a rip-roaring time, Fred. We'll go
      all the gaits, even if we get put in the lock-up.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>RED and his jovial
      employer spent a ===day and night at New Orleans, and early the following
      morning took a fast train for New York. Ensconced in the luxurious
      Pullman, which contained few other passengers, Fred felt that by remaining
      close in the car as it passed through Georgia he would run little risk of
      being recognized by any acquaintance or friend of the past. Nevertheless,
      as the train was leaving Atlanta and speeding toward Stafford, he was
      literally besieged with gloomy memories. Every station or familiar
      landmark along the way brought back with crushing force occurrences he had
      completely forgotten. Once or twice he fancied that Whipple was watching
      him with an unusually sympathetic eye, but he put the thought from him.
      Never having been told of the fact, how could the old man even suspect
      that he was nearing the home of his childhood&mdash;the spot of his
      dreams? He had a yearning to confide more fully to his kindly companion,
      but the thought came to him that such a disclosure just now might throw a
      damper upon a journey which he had determined should contain nothing but
      joy to his benefactor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was six o'clock when Cherry Hill was reached. Only seven rapidly
      shortening miles lay between him and his old home. Fred sat at a window,
      pretending to read a newspaper. It struck him as highly incongruous that
      Whipple should think no more of that particular town than of any of the
      others through which they had passed when it means so much&mdash;so very
      much&mdash;to him. The time-table told him that the train stopped only a
      few minutes at Stafford, and he was both glad and disappointed&mdash;glad
      that the short stop would render his detection the more remote, and sad
      that he was not to see with his actual eyes the spot dearer to him than
      any other. There was a prolonged scream from the locomotive's whistle at
      the extreme end of the train. Could it be that the station was reached?
      No, for through the gathering dusk Fred could see that the suburbs of the
      town, as indicated by the electric lights in the distance, were still half
      a mile away. Perhaps it was to take on water, he thought; but that
      couldn't be the explanation, for the porter of the car had thrown up a
      window and was looking out inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he inquired of the porter, who had drawn his head back into
      the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, sir,&rdquo; the negro answered. &ldquo;Something must be wrong ahead.
      We never slow up till we get to the crossing.&rdquo; He hurriedly left the car,
      and Fred followed. Outside there was a rushing to and fro of trainmen with
      flags and lanterns, a jumble of calls in stentorian tones, the slow
      clanging of the locomotive's bell, the exhausting of steam. The porter ran
      to the porter of the car ahead, and came back to where Walton stood
      waiting on the step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Freight-train knocked all to smash in the edge of town,&rdquo; he explained.
      &ldquo;Nobody hurt, but it is sure to hold us here awhile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have to stop, then!&rdquo; Fred exclaimed, fearing a vague something
      which seemed to hover, like a threat, in the air about him. At that moment
      he gave way to the superstitious feeling that it was the direct hand of
      Providence which had delayed him there, of all spots on the long journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks like it now, sir,&rdquo; the porter answered; and as he left, Walton
      turned and saw Whipple close beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it won't make any difference to us,&rdquo; the old man said, in evident
      wonder over his protégé's disappointment. &ldquo;We'll be sound asleep in our
      berths. I don't know but what I'd kind o' like <i>one</i> night's rest
      without so much jostle and motion. We can get a good breakfast in the
      dining-car in the morning, and go on our way as smooth as goose-grease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Fred said. But the thought had come to him that they might be
      delayed till the next morning, and the idea of passing through his old
      home in the broad light of day was far from pleasant. What if he should
      actually meet his father or some officer of the law whose duty it would be
      to arrest him, right when he had begun to hope that he might ultimately
      earn his freedom?
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred went back into the car, followed by the drowsy Whipple, and took a
      seat by a window. It was open, and by leaning out he could see the lights
      of Stafford. Under the skies he had known as a child, on the same
      hillsides, they blazed and beckoned. Suppressing a groan, he told himself
      that he would go to bed and try to sleep; but he delayed, held in his
      place by some weird charm. At ten o'clock, when Whipple was stowed away,
      Fred went out of the car once more. On the sidetrack he met the conductor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long shall we be here?&rdquo; Walton inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till three o'clock, sir,&rdquo; the conductor said, as they walked along toward
      the locomotive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if I'd have time to walk to town and look around,&rdquo; Fred said. &ldquo;I
      don't feel like turning in right now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty, plenty,&rdquo; the conductor answered. &ldquo;It is only a mile or so to the
      square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'll go,&rdquo; Walton said, and he walked away, thankful that the night
      was cloudy. On he went down the railway, in the streaming glare of the
      locomotive's headlight, till he reached the first street leading into
      Stafford. Ahead, in the light of many lanterns, a throng of trackmen were
      at work on the wreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      How changed was the landscape he had once known so well! Spots which had
      been old barren fields, dismantled brick-yards, and stretches of forest,
      were now, thanks to the enterprise of Kenneth Galt, filled with cottages,
      cotton factories, iron-foundries, and other industries. To the right, on a
      common, which used to be the ball-ground where the team, of which Fred had
      been the popular captain, had played in his schooldays, the round-house
      and machine-shops of the S. R. &amp; M. had risen. New thoroughfares had
      been opened, natural elevations graded away, and uncouth gullies filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking the darker and quieter streets by choice, Walton strode onward,
      headed toward the old part of town, his heart wrung with a pain more
      poignant than any he had ever felt. Once, as he was passing through a
      cluster of small houses which seemed inhabited by negroes, he saw a few
      dusky faces he had known, and recognized some familiar voices coming from
      the unlighted porches and open windows. On trudged the wayfarer, his step
      slow, his feet heavy. Presently he came to a stone and iron bridge which
      spanned a small arm of the river, and, crossing to the other side, he
      ascended a slight elevation from which he had a view of the entire town.
      It was a lonely, unimproved spot, where a few scrubby pines grew and some
      gray primitive bowlders lay half embedded in the ground. Farther along the
      brow of the narrow hill stood the old brick school, which, as a boy, he
      had attended. A thousand memories flogged his quickened brain&mdash;memories
      of those lost days, when his gentle mother had dressed him and sent him
      off with a kiss and the admonition to be a good boy. She was dead, she was
      gone forever, and her prayers in his behalf had fallen on the deaf ear of
      Infinite Providence. He had not been a good boy, and she had prayed in
      vain. Her grave was there beyond the town's lights on another hill, and he
      who had been the sole hope of her motherhood was an alien. He stifled a
      cry of sheer agony. In his active life in the West he had, in a measure,
      dulled his senses to much of the past, but here, in view of all he had
      lost, it was upon him like a monster as long and broad as the universe,
      with a million sinister claws sunken into his being. There below was the
      home which might have been his; there, veiled from his sight by the kindly
      pall of night, lived the men and women who might still have been his
      friends; there, too, lived the girl, the one girl in all the earth, who&mdash;He
      groaned, and, throwing himself on the ground, he folded his arms and
      sobbed. How long he remained there he hardly knew, but it was late, for
      the lights in the houses below were blinking and going out one by one. He
      was tempted to steal down the hillside, now that deeper darkness offered
      shelter, and wander through the streets he had loved so well&mdash;to
      wander on till he could see his father's house. Perhaps he might even pass
      Margaret's home without detection. It would be a risk, an awful risk, he
      told himself, for he might be recognized, pursued, and even arrested. His
      hungry heart told him to take the chance, his inbred caution warned him
      strongly to return to the car without delay, and yet he lingered. He
      fancied he could see, as his blurred eyes strove to probe the curtain of
      darkness, the very spot his old home stood upon. Yes, he would risk it. He
      had been away for years, and he might never return to the old town again.
      Providence itself had caused the accident to which he owed the
      opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the incline he went, into the quiet street below, and along it to
      another which led toward his father's house. Once he saw a man and woman
      approaching, and he stepped behind a high fence in the grounds of an old
      mill. He crouched down, and heard their voices as they went by, but they
      sounded strange to him. He followed now in their wake, and saw them turn
      in another direction. Then he saw a man approaching, but he walked from
      side to side of the pavement, as if he were intoxicated, and Walton
      avoided him by crossing the street and pursuing his way on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he was at his old home. The grounds were the same in size, but the
      old house had been repainted, and trees which had been small and slender
      were now large and dense. There was a heartless alteration in the
      appearance of it all. The white paint on the house somehow made it seem a
      veritable ghost of its former self; its whole aspect was cold and
      forbidding. He opened the gate and entered. He was not afraid, for as a
      boy he had gone into the grounds at any hour he liked; he had even raised
      an unfastened window in the old dining-room, when he had mislaid his key,
      and climbed in long after midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a light in his father's room on the ground floor, but the blind
      was drawn down. Fred could not look in from where he stood, so he crept up
      close to the wall, and moved noiselessly along against it till he could
      peer through the crack between the window-sill and the blind. He started
      back, for in the light of the green-shaded lamp he saw his father seated
      at a table reading a paper. How strange it seemed to see him after all
      those years! And yet the banker had changed very little. It was the same
      harsh, imperturbable face. In it lay no sign of concern over the absence
      of the son who now loved him with a woman's tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor, poor father!&rdquo; the young man said, in his heart. &ldquo;I never understood
      you. I didn't know what life meant then as I do now. You are living
      according to your lights. It was I who was wrong&mdash;wofully wrong. God
      help me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a low groan he crept away. Out into the street he went. He must hurry
      now, for his time was limited. There must be no mistake about the train.
      He must not let his employer suspect this stolen excursion of his, for it
      would mar the pleasure of the old man's journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred now met and had to avoid few passers-by, and he hurried on to
      Margaret's home, thankful that it lay in the direction of the waiting
      train. The great structure was wholly dark, and there was no sign of life
      about it. That was her window; he could plainly see it as he stood at the
      fence. But what, after all, could it matter to him? Perhaps she had not
      occupied the room for years. His heart seemed turned to stone as the new
      fear sank into him that she might have married and moved away. She had
      loved him once; he was as sure of that as he was of her honesty. Yes, she
      had loved him! She had told him so with her arms tightly clasped about his
      neck. His shameful conduct had separated them&mdash;that and nothing else.
      With his head lowered he turned away, wholly indifferent now as to whether
      he was seen or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost before he realized it the wrecked freight-cars were before him; the
      track was being rapidly cleared; the headlight of the train that was to
      bear him away was streaming on him with insistent fierceness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long will you keep us waiting?&rdquo; he asked the foreman of the gang,
      who, in greased and blackened overalls, stood near an overturned truck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only an hour or so longer. It is past one now,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pullman was dimly lighted from the overhead lamps which were turned
      low, but the outer door was open, and, passing the porter half asleep in
      the smoking-room, Fred went to his berth, drew the curtains aside, and
      began to undress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Fred?&rdquo; a low, anxious voice inquired, and Whipple thrust his
      shaggy head out from his berth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. Is there anything I can do for you, Mr. Whipple?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; that is&mdash;&rdquo; The curtains slowly parted, and the old man came out,
      completely dressed, save for the absence of his coat, collar, and cravat.
      He looked around cautiously, and seemed relieved to find that they were
      the only passengers awake. He sank into a seat opposite Fred's berth and
      sighed. &ldquo;I've been awfully worried,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You see, my boy, I missed
      you. I waited and waited and couldn't sleep a wink, and the longer you
      stayed away the worse I got. You see, I have my clothes on. I got up, and
      went out to the wreck, and tried to find you. I don't know what got into
      me. I was worried&mdash;worried like rips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt restless and&mdash;went for a walk,&rdquo; Walton explained, lamely. &ldquo;I
      didn't know it was so late; besides, I thought you'd be sound asleep and
      not miss me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I'm old and childish,&rdquo; Whipple said, with a forced laugh. &ldquo;The
      fact is, Fred, if the truth must be told, I reckon I feel powerful close
      to you. I didn't know the thing had taken such a deep hold on me. I reckon
      it is this trip with just you and me off together like two boys. I've got
      so I think I can detect when you are happy and when you ain't over your
      old trouble, and ever since morning I sort o' fancied you looked uneasy
      and downhearted. Then when you went off, leaving me away out here all by
      myself, why, somehow, I was afraid&mdash;actually afraid that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were afraid that in my despondency I might injure myself,&rdquo; Fred broke
      in; &ldquo;but you needn't ever&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn't afraid of any such thing!&rdquo; Whipple threw in, almost indignantly.
      &ldquo;I knew there was no such danger when you had fought the fight you have
      for six years hand-running, and got as high up as you have; but I was a
      little afraid&mdash;well, to be honest&mdash;I was afraid you might have
      seen somebody on the train who you wanted to avoid on account of matters
      long past and buried, and that you thought it might be advisable to&mdash;to
      keep out of sight, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't that, Mr. Whipple, I assure you,&rdquo; Walton answered, in a husky
      voice, and he sat down opposite his friend and laid his hands firmly on
      the old man's knees. &ldquo;The time has come, Mr. Whipple, when I must tell you
      more about my past life. After I have done so, you will fully understand
      how I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I won't listen!&rdquo; Whipple raised his hands in protest. &ldquo;I don't
      want to hear a word. It wrings my silly old heart, anyway, to think of
      what may lie away back there before you come to me. You seem to be a son
      of my own, born to me in your terrible trouble, and I want to think of you
      that way. I thought, at first, that it would be a pretty thing to let you
      pay back the debt hanging over you with just your own earnings; but I
      don't think so now. That amount of money would be nothing to me, and you
      know it. You've seen me donate more than that to causes that didn't
      interest me one-hundredth part as much as this does. My boy, when we get
      to New York I'll draw the money, and you must take it and clear yourself.
      I'll never rest till you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't do that, Mr. Whipple,&rdquo; Walton said, in a grateful tone. &ldquo;When I
      left home I told my father the money should be replaced by my own
      earnings, and it must be that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't keep me from raising your salary if I see fit and proper,&rdquo;
       Whipple argued. &ldquo;You are the best man I ever employed from any standpoint,
      and you don't draw pay enough&mdash;not half enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't let you do it,&rdquo; Walton said, with a grateful smile. &ldquo;I am already
      paid more than any other man in my position. To give me more would be
      charity, and I don't want that. I want to pay my way out, Mr. Whipple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you'll do it,&rdquo; the old man gave in, fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you was to be hampered now, my brave boy, I'd actually lose faith in
      God and the hereafter. I honestly believe you'll get your reward, and be
      reinstated in all you ever wanted. Now, good-night. Sleep sound, and let's
      not allow this to spoil our good time. I reckon this trip has sort o'
      turned your thoughts onto bygone days, but we'll have other things to
      think of in New York. Good-night, my son, good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heavy curtains hid the portly old man, and Walton proceeded to undress
      and lie down. But he could not sleep. What human being with a normal heart
      could have done so under like circumstances? An hour later the dull,
      rumbling movement of the car told him that they were off. There was no
      stop at the station, but Walton propped himself upon his elbow and raised
      the little window-shade and peered out as they passed through the
      switch-yard of the town. On the platform a night-watchman stood swinging a
      lantern. In the rapidly shifting glare of light Fred recognized him. It
      was Dan Smith, a faithful negro who used to work about the bank and whom
      Fred had known from childhood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old Uncle Dan!&rdquo; the outcast said, bitterly, as the kindly features
      were spirited away in the distance.' &ldquo;You know why 'Marse Freddie' had to
      leave, don't you? It was because he was a thief, Uncle Dan. The little
      fellow you used to carry on your shoulders and be so proud of grew up to
      be a thief&mdash;a <i>thief</i>, and he is hiding now from you and all the
      rest!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE two friends had
      been in New York five days, and in the continual round of theatres, and in
      sight-seeing, with occasional call at some establishment with which
      Whipple had dealings, they spent the time very pleasantly. The pain caused
      by Fred's secret visit to his old home was, in a measure, assuaged by his
      constant effort to be cheerful for the sake of his benefactor's enjoyment.
      He felt that he was succeeding, and the realization of the fact buoyed him
      up to further activity in self-obliteration. On occasion, Whipple acted
      like a college boy off on a lark. He passed funny criticisms on the
      persons they saw on the streets and in the cars, and at the table of the
      café where they got their meals he purposely blundered over the French
      words on the menu, to the great mystification of the polite waiter, who
      found it impossible to reconcile actual ignorance with the costly clothing
      Whipple wore and his extravagant tips and liberal orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the sixth morning of their stay in the metropolis they went down to pay
      a promised visit to Lewis Marston, the importer of teas and coffees from
      whom Whipple had received many a shipment and had met once or twice in New
      Orleans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So <i>this</i> is the Mr. Spencer you've written me about so often?&rdquo;
       Marston smiled cordially as he was introduced to Fred, and begged them to
      take seats in the spacious office of which he was the only occupant.
      &ldquo;Young man, as we used to say in the South, your ears ought to burn, for
      your boss has written me lots of good things about you. I remember he
      wrote last winter that his business was growing out of all bounds, owing
      to the fresh blood and modern ideas you had put into it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fred flushed modestly as he released the hand of the portly, pink-faced,
      side-whiskered old merchant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Whipple is noted for his generosity,&rdquo; he said, lamely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are the only one of his force he has mentioned to me, at any
      rate,&rdquo; the importer said, persistently, &ldquo;and I know he means it, for a man
      who has ability and can be thoroughly trusted is hard to find these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three sat and chatted for an hour, Marston being interrupted now and
      then by a telegram or a question asked by some clerk who came from an
      adjoining room, where there was a din of clicking typewriting machines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we'll have to go,&rdquo; Whipple said, as he arose. &ldquo;Fred has got some
      letters of instructions to write home, and I'm due in Wall Street at this
      very minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To write letters!&rdquo; Marston cried. &ldquo;Well, he needn't go away to do that.
      Do you see that desk at the window? It is for the sole use of our
      customers. There is plenty of stationery. Sit down, Mr. Spencer. I'll have
      to leave soon myself. My wife is coming to get me to help her select some
      Persian rugs, and you'll have the whole office to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good plan, Fred,&rdquo; Whipple exclaimed; &ldquo;then we could meet at the Astor
      House and take lunch together at one o'clock. I want to see what the old
      place is like. My daddy stopped there once before the war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the idea!&rdquo; the importer chimed in. &ldquo;Make yourself thoroughly at
      home, Mr. Spencer. If you need anything, just tap that bell and the boy
      will attend to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When his employer had left, Fred sat down at the desk and began to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I forgot,&rdquo; Marston said, apologetically, as he looked up from the
      letter he was writing. &ldquo;I will call a stenographer, if you'd like to
      dictate your correspondence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you,&rdquo; Fred answered, &ldquo;it won't be necessary; I have only a few
      lines to write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had completed the task before him, and was waiting for an opportunity
      to leave without interrupting the merchant, who was busily writing at his
      desk, when an office-boy came and spoke to Marston in an undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she's not alone, then!&rdquo; the merchant said aloud, as he pushed back
      his chair. &ldquo;Send them up. I am not quite ready yet, and they will have to
      wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment later a cheery feminine voice&mdash;evidently Mrs. Marston's&mdash;sounded
      in the corridor outside, where her husband stood waiting for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm glad you came along, too, Miss Margaret,&rdquo; Fred heard the old
      man saying. &ldquo;You must sit down in my dusty office for a moment.&rdquo; He made
      an effort at lowering his voice, but it was still audible. &ldquo;There is only
      one man there, but he is young and decidedly good-looking. By-the-way, he
      is that Mr. Spencer, the phenomenal young business man I told you about.
      Come in, and I'll let you entertain him till I can get away. I've got to
      run down to the main salesroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I've got to telephone the cook.&rdquo; It was evidently Mrs. Marston's
      voice again. &ldquo;We are going back to lunch. The General has promised to meet
      us there. Where is the booth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the end of the corridor,&rdquo; Marston was heard directing her. &ldquo;Now, come
      on, young lady. By George, that <i>is</i> a stunning gown! The new
      railroad helped pay for that, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thin canvas door was pushed open. Fred stood up; his eyes dilated; his
      blood ran cold. It was Margaret Dearing to whom the voluble merchant was
      casually introducing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret started and paled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. <i>Spencer!</i>&rdquo; she echoed, then quickly averted her face from the
      inattentive glance of her host.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walton's eyes went down as he bowed, white and quivering. He could say
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I'll leave you two to get acquainted,&rdquo; Marston said, quite
      unconscious that anything unusual had happened, and, gathering up some
      sheets of paper from his desk, he hastened away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret!&rdquo; Walton gasped, when they were alone in the awful silence of
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Spencer?&mdash;<i>Spencer?</i>&rdquo; the young lady groped, as she gazed
      on him in helpless wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forgive me, I had to change my name!&rdquo; he panted, as he stood white as
      death could have made him under her timid, almost frightened stare. &ldquo;I had
      no other reason than that I wanted to live down my disgrace, and it looked
      like it would be impossible otherwise. I was a drowning man, Margaret,
      grasping at a straw; a new life opened out to me, and I entered it with
      the hope that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand!&rdquo; the girl gasped, and she drew herself up in pained
      haughtiness and twisted her gloved hands tightly in front of her. &ldquo;But
      need we&mdash;talk about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven't even <i>that</i> right,&rdquo; Walton declared, as he looked at
      the woman, grown infinitely more beautiful and graceful than even her
      girlhood had foreshadowed. &ldquo;I promised Wynn the night I left that I'd
      never insult you by coming in contact with you again, or even addressing a
      line to you. I knew we had to part&mdash;that I could best serve you by
      going away never to return. Your brother was right. He acted only as any
      honorable man should in talking to me as he did. I was insane to aspire to
      your friendship with that thing hanging over me; but it was the insanity
      of love, Margaret&mdash;a love that never can die. I ought not to say it
      now, but what does it matter? I am not fit for you to wipe your feet on. I
      am still a fugitive from justice&mdash;a criminal living under an assumed
      name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, for she had collapsed limply into Marston's chair, and was
      resting her white brow on her bloodless hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't&mdash;it is&mdash;is killing me!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I had thought we
      might never meet again. I was beginning to hope that, in time, the memory
      of&mdash;of it all would be less painful, but it is revived again. Oh, it
      is unbearable!&rdquo; He took a deep, trembling breath, and moved a step nearer
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But even <i>you</i> will grant that, by continued effort, I may purge my
      soul of it&mdash;at least, in the eyes of God,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don't mean
      that I could ever ask you to receive me openly as an equal after what has
      happened, but you will, at least, be glad that I am honestly striving to
      lead a better life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;oh yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am not <i>wholly</i> living under false colors,&rdquo; he went on,
      anxiously. &ldquo;I have confessed the worst to my employer, and he is doing all
      he can to help me. He trusts me. I don't like to say these things in my
      own behalf, and yet surely you will forgive me for saying that I am, at
      least, not living as I used to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You intend to make&mdash;make reparation?&rdquo; she said, raising an awful
      glance to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. I have sent back all my savings so far&mdash;every dollar I
      could get together; and before another year is past I hope to send enough,
      at least, to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money!&rdquo; she cried, almost in a tone of disgust&mdash;and as she spoke she
      had a picture of a golden-haired child with a sunny face playing on the
      lawn at her home&mdash;&ldquo;money! As if that would count in a matter like&mdash;like
      <i>that!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all I can do now, Margaret!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he shrank under the
      unexpected severity of her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume so,&rdquo; she answered, coldly, even sternly, and she fixed an
      unreadable stare on his blighted face; &ldquo;and yet if you could be back at
      home, and see what I have seen, perhaps you'd realize that there are
      things mere money cannot restore. I can't blame you wholly&mdash;to save
      my life, I can't! The temptation was deliberately put in your track; you
      were not born with the power to resist, and so you fell like many another
      man has fallen, but you ought to have stayed on at Stafford and done your
      duty&mdash;your <i>full</i> duty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't! I assure you, I <i>couldn't</i>, Margaret!&rdquo; he went on,
      almost piteously, his lips quivering under stress of the vast emotion let
      loose within him. &ldquo;My father would have punished me by law&mdash;would
      have deprived me of every chance to atone in the way that I am now trying
      to atone. But I have no right to talk to you this way. I am breaking my
      promise to Wynn. By my own act, I have banished myself from you forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, forever!&rdquo; she admitted, as her proud head went down. &ldquo;There is
      nothing either of us can do. We must try not to meet again, even by
      accident. I must join Mrs. Marston now. I hear her in the corridor. You
      are very pale, and she might wonder and imagine all sorts of things. I'd
      have to introduce you, and I can't even remember your&mdash;your new name.
      I will tell no one at home that I have seen you. You may trust that to me.
      Your secret is safe. I can't recall the name of the place you live in. I
      sha'n't try. I never have believed it was <i>all</i> your fault&mdash;that
      is, not <i>all</i>. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he repeated, huskily; and he saw her rise, and, without
      extending her hand, or giving him another glance, she moved unsteadily
      toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was gone he sat down at the desk and took up his pen, and with an
      inanimate hand began to address one of his letters, wondering dumbly that
      such mere details as a street and number and a man's initials could rise
      to his memory at such a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, in the big drawing-room at the Marstons', General Sylvester
      sat down by his niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look tired,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think you show it more than usual; being on
      one's feet all day is no little tax on the energy. By-the-way, we are
      invited to a big reception for next Wednesday evening at the Langleys'. It
      is given to some foreign statesman or other. I have the card somewhere.
      You must look your prettiest and wear the dandy gown I selected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it isn't for evening wear.&rdquo; Margaret smiled faintly. &ldquo;Besides, do
      you think we ought to stay as&mdash;long as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As long as that?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Are you really thinking of going home?
      Of course, it lies with you, dear. As far as I am personally concerned, it
      doesn't matter one way or the other. Say, little girl, are you really
      homesick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I am, Uncle Tom.&rdquo; She avoided his eyes, which were so
      solicitously bearing down on her from beneath their heavy brows. &ldquo;I
      presume the novelty of this sort of thing soon wears off, and our home is
      so soothing and restful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I smell a rat!&rdquo; the General said, teasingly. &ldquo;I forgot about that
      lonely bachelor neighbor of ours. We were to look after him, weren't we?
      Well, we'll go back, and you'll encourage him a little more, won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl shuddered, an irrepressible sob struggled up within her, and her
      head sank to her tightly clasped hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how <i>can</i> you say such a thing?&rdquo; she asked, under her breath. &ldquo;I
      don't love him. I know I can never do so now, and to think of what you
      want is&mdash;horrible!&rdquo; To the old man's utter bewilderment she rose,
      placed her handkerchief to her lips, and left the room.

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">K</span>ENNETH GALT was
      now living the life of a recluse in his old home. The tendency to this
      sort of existence belongs to rare and exceptional temperaments. He kept
      assuring himself that it was to be only for a time, that when Sylvester
      returned with his stately niece he would crawl out of his morbid husk and
      bask in their genial hospitality. Of course, he told himself, this gloomy
      period of solitary self-accusation simply must not continue. He had taken
      steps which no living man could retrace in his decision in regard to
      Dora's fate and the fate of her child, and there was nothing left for him
      to do but to try to forget his part in the tragedy. If he now feared that
      he might never again have complete peace of mind in regard to the girl's
      condition, it was due to his present unwise proximity to her, and to his
      queer, almost ecstatic, pride in his son. Some men are coarse enough to
      have a contempt for the rights, social and otherwise, of their own
      children of illegitimate birth; but Kenneth Galt, in despising many of the
      laws of man, gave little Lionel the credit of being the product of a law
      he himself had made, and which, therefore, was worthy of consideration. In
      some States the declaration by a pair that they intend to live together
      constitutes a legal marriage, and it was with that broad view that Dora,
      blinded by faith in the superior knowledge of her lover, had
      unquestioningly delivered herself. He shuddered as the conviction struck
      into him that, under the same temptation that had swerved him from
      fidelity to their pact, <i>she</i> would have remained firm. She was
      scarcely more than a child when he deserted her. What, he asked himself,
      had she developed into? Dearing said she was more beautiful than ever,
      and as for her advance in strength of mind and soul, there were her
      pictures to witness. And as he looked at them day after day their subtle,
      creative depth grew upon him. He had made a fair financial success; but
      what he had done, he now told himself, was only what butchers and cobblers
      had accomplished. What she was doing, in her exile from her kind, was the
      work of deathless inspiration. Dearing had once aptly said that God used
      Evil as the fertilizer to the soil of Good, and if so, to carry the
      analogy further, Galt, in his craving for the praise of the world, and in
      his cowardly shrinking from Right, was the impure soil in which the flower
      of Dora's genius was being nurtured. Yes, there was no denying it. Fate
      was playing a sardonic game with him. Dora, cloaked in suffering frailty,
      and championed by Truth and Spirit, was pitted against him, the carping,
      sourfaced apostle of man's puny material rights; she would go on, and he
      would go on. What would be the goal, and which the ultimate winner? He had
      argued that the grave and nothingness comprised the pot of dross at the
      end of every life's rainbow; but was he right? Could that mysterious,
      compelling sense of fatherhood; the thrill of boundless ecstasy, when he
      held Lionel in his arms; the awful brooding over the boy's future; the
      infinite rebuke of the child's fathomless eyes&mdash;could such things be
      mere functions of matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in his library when these reflections were passing through his
      brain, and his attention was attracted by children's voices somewhere
      outside raised to a high pitch of anger. Stepping to a window, he looked
      out toward the house of his neighbor, Congressman Weston. He was just in
      time to see Weston's son, Grover, climb over the low paling fence, and,
      with a loud and abusive threat, approach Lionel, who was shorter by a
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said I shouldn't say it again,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;but I do! She is not fit
      for anybody to go with. My mother wouldn't notice her, and no other nice
      lady would. People <i>don't</i>&mdash;they don't go near her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galt's blood was shocked to stillness in his veins, and then, as if by
      reactionary process, it began to boil. He saw the erect figure of his son
      stand as if stunned for an instant, and then, like a young tiger, Lionel
      sprang at the other boy, his little hands balled. Galt heard the blows as
      they fell on young Weston's fat cheeks, and he chuckled and ground his
      teeth in blended satisfaction and rage. He sprang through the open window
      to the grass, and hurriedly skirted a clump of boxwood just in time to see
      Grover Weston recovering from the unexpected onslaught and beginning to
      rain blow after blow upon Lionel's white face. The contest was close,
      despite the inequality in ages and sizes; but the nameless scion of the
      Gaits, unconscious of his heritage of bravery, was unconquerable. He was
      there to fight, justly roused as he was, to his last breath. For one
      instant Grover tore himself from Lionel's bear-like clutch, and stood
      glowering in sheer astonishment from his battered and bruised face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You little bastard, I'll&mdash;&rdquo; And he suddenly hurled his fist into
      Lionel's face with all his force. It was a staggering blow, but Lionel met
      it without a whimper or the loss of a breath. He sprang again at his
      assailant, and, catching him around the neck with his strong left arm, he
      battered the other boy's face with blow after blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hit him&mdash;that's right, hit him, Lionel!&rdquo; Galt cried out, in utter
      forgetfulness of his own incongruous position. &ldquo;Beat his nasty face to a
      pulp while you've got him! If you don't do it now, he'll down you when he
      gets free. Give him his medicine, and give him a full dose. That's the
      thing&mdash;trip him up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without sparing an instant to look, but having recognized Galt's voice,
      Lionel bent his wiry body toward accomplishing the trick advised. The two
      combatants swung back and forth, still bound together by Lionel's clutch,
      till finally they went down side by side. And then ensued another struggle
      as to which should get on top.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throw your leg over!&rdquo; Galt cried out. &ldquo;Ah, that's a beauty! Now, beat him
      till he takes it back!&rdquo; Lionel needed no such advice. His little fists
      moved like the spokes of a turning wheel. A shrill howl of defeat rose
      from the conquered bully, and he uttered a prolonged scream of genuine
      alarm. Then emerged from a side door of the Weston house no less a
      personage than the Congressman himself, and he ran across the grass,
      taking flower-pots and beds of roses at long leaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the fighters, he grasped Lionel by the collar of his blouse and
      drew him off of his cowering son. And as he held him, squirming like a
      cat, he turned on Galt. &ldquo;Damn it, man!&rdquo; he cried, in breathless fury,
      &ldquo;what do you mean by standing here and encouraging this brat to fight my
      boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I only wanted to see fair play, that's all,&rdquo; Galt replied, a
      dangerous gleam in his eyes. &ldquo;I happened to hear your big bully of a son
      dare the little one to fight him, and he brought it on by insulting the
      little fellow's mother. God bless him, he didn't need my advice. He could
      whip two such whelps as yours, and never half try! He hasn't a cowardly
      bone in his body! He was all there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it seems to me, <i>you</i> are in a pretty business!&rdquo; Weston
      retorted, white with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might be even more active than I am, Weston,&rdquo; Galt said, with cold
      significance, &ldquo;and if you are not satisfied with the part I have taken,
      you only have to say the word. You know that well enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Congressman was taken aback. There was something in the unruffled tone
      and meaning stare of his neighbor's eyes that perplexed and quelled him.
      He now turned upon his sniffling offspring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go in the house!&rdquo; he said, angrily. &ldquo;You are always picking at some
      child under your size. I have noticed it.&rdquo; Weston was a politician before
      anything else, and the thought of turning against him a man who controlled
      as many votes as did the president of the greatest railway in the State
      was not particularly inviting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean to offend you, Galt,&rdquo; he said, as his boy limped away,
      still mopping his eyes with his fists. &ldquo;I reckon I got hot because it was
      my own flesh and blood. Of course, it was natural for you to sympathize
      with the smaller of the two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the way <i>I</i> felt about it, Weston,&rdquo; Galt said, staring coldly
      at the speaker. &ldquo;I have nothing at all to apologize for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll see that Grover behaves himself better in future,&rdquo; the
      Congressman said, still with his political eye open to advantages. &ldquo;Of
      course, it would be natural for a child like mine to pick up remarks
      floating about among older people in regard to the mother of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll let that drop, <i>too</i>, Weston!&rdquo; Galt snarled. His lip quivered
      ominously as he glanced significantly at Lionel, who was listening
      attentively, the blood from a bruised nose trickling down to his chin and
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I understand,&rdquo; the Congressman said; and he moved awkwardly
      away, wondering what manner of man the frigid and reticent Galt was, after
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I've got myself in a pretty mess,&rdquo; Lionel remarked, ruefully,
      when Weston had left him and his father together. &ldquo;My mother has made me
      promise time after time not to fight; but, you see, I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see you did,&rdquo; Galt responded, a lump of queer approval in his
      throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't help it&mdash;I really couldn't,&rdquo; Lionel said, with a rueful
      look at his hands, which were covered with the blood of his antagonist. &ldquo;I
      must be a bad boy; but oh, I couldn't let him say my beautiful mother&mdash;my
      sweet mo&mdash;&rdquo; He choked up. &ldquo;I couldn't&mdash;I simply couldn't! She is
      so sweet and good! I couldn't help it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not, but don't worry about it,&rdquo; Galt said, sunken to depths of
      shame he had never reached before. &ldquo;You must try to forget it&mdash;forget
      the whole thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid my mother will find out about it, and, you know, she
      mustn't,&rdquo; the child said, his great eyes filled with concern. &ldquo;She would
      ask what the boy said, and Granny says she must never be told nasty things
      children say to me. Such things make her sad and keep her from painting.
      She must not find out about this&mdash;this fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she really need not know,&rdquo; Galt said, as the heat of his shame
      mantled his face and brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she <i>will</i>,&rdquo; Lionel insisted, gloomily, &ldquo;for she is sure to see
      this blood on me. It is on my neck, and running down under my collar. Do
      you suppose I could get it off without soiling my waist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galt unbuttoned the broad white collar, and drew it away from the child's
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It hasn't touched it yet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Wait a moment!&rdquo; And he adroitly, and
      yet with oddly quivering fingers, inserted his own handkerchief between
      the collar and the trickling blood. &ldquo;Now come into the house, and I'll fix
      you up. Your clothes are a little rumpled, but when I have washed the
      blood off no one need know about your fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that would be a <i>fine</i> idea!&rdquo; Lionel exclaimed, joyfully. He put
      his little hand into his father's, and together they went into the house.
      &ldquo;She won't know, will she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she need not know,&rdquo; Galt said aloud; but in his thought he added:
      &ldquo;Lionel, you are a little gentleman. You are a living proof that blood
      will tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lonely man's heart was warmed by an inward glow of pride which was
      quickly succeeded by an icy breath of despair that seemed to blow over
      him. This, he reflected, was only the introductory part of the vast soul
      tragedy he himself had put on the stage of existence. The trials he had
      encountered through young manhood were naught to those foreshadowed in the
      unsuspecting and trusting face at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the bath,&rdquo; he said, as they reached the white-tiled room on the
      second floor. &ldquo;Now go in, and be careful to take off your blouse without
      getting it bloody. If we are going to work this thing we must work it
      right. Perhaps you'd better strip and bathe all over. It will make you
      feel good anyway, after that fierce round of yours. Let me fill the tub.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I'd better, maybe,&rdquo; acquiesced Lionel. &ldquo;Well, be careful,&rdquo; Galt
      warned him, as he turned on the two streams of water and tested the
      blending temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really can't unbutton this collar behind,&rdquo; Lionel said, with a touch of
      manly shame over the confession. &ldquo;My mother always does it. She has never
      let me learn. I am big enough, gracious knows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, let me undress you!&rdquo; the father said, as he hastily dried his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would, if you'll be so kind,&rdquo; Lionel said, in a tone of
      reliance, which somehow reached an hitherto untouched fount of feeling in
      the breast of his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the child stood before him, Galt, with throbbing pulse and reverent
      fingers, found himself doing the duties of a mother to his offspring. The
      flowing necktie and collar were removed; next the blouse and underbody.
      Then a vision of inexplicable and awe-inspiring beauty greeted the senses
      of the beholder, as the symetrical form, a veritable poem in flesh and
      blood, stood bared to his sight. He laid the still unsoiled garments on a
      chair, and lifted the boy in his arms to put him into the water. The warm,
      smooth cheek touched his own; a tingling throb of paternity&mdash;of
      starving, yearning fatherhood&mdash;shot through him as he held the boy
      across his arms like a baby and lowered him slowly to the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out, I'll duck you!&rdquo; he said, jestingly, and the boy replied with a
      ringing laugh which held no hint of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the water the child lay with his face smilingly upturned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;it feels good. This tub is big enough to swim in&mdash;a
      little bit, anyway. Will you show me how to swim some day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my son&mdash;yes, Lionel, some day, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In <i>deep</i> water&mdash;in a really-really stream that fish swim in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Lionel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that would be so nice! Couldn't we catch fish, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so&mdash;yes, of course, some day, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But would those delights, conceived for the first time to-day, ever be
      realized? Galt asked himself, as keen pangs from some unknown source
      darted through him. Sick unto death of the vapid adulation of narrow men
      and women, would he ever experience the transcendental joy of intimate and
      daily companionship with this human wonder, such as other fathers enjoyed
      with their sons?
    </p>
    <p>
      No, the question was already answered. The bliss&mdash;the queer,
      Heaven-tending bliss of the present moment&mdash;was merely stolen. Was it
      likely that any son at all would ever come to him&mdash;a son which he
      could father in the broadest, holiest sense? No; and he started and fell
      to quivering superstitiously. Even if he were married and another son was
      given to him in lawful wedlock, could he dare&mdash;in the face of
      Infinite Justice&mdash;dare to put <i>that</i> child forward, acknowledge
      <i>that</i> child as his own, while <i>deserting, ignoring, denying</i>
      Lionel?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; his quaking soul cried out in sheer anguish. &ldquo;Lionel, my son;
      my boy, made in the image of her and me, he who trusts and so innocently
      loves me! And yet it must be. Fate has ordained it. I have his faith and
      love now, but later he may turn on me like an avenging angel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother soaps me all over before I get out. Must I do it?&rdquo; the child
      asked, as his merry, haunting eyes smiled up through their long, wet
      lashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won't be necessary this time,&rdquo; Galt said. &ldquo;The blood is entirely
      washed off. Get out and let me dry you with this big towel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh! it is cold.&rdquo; The boy shuddered, as he stood out on the rug and
      allowed himself to be enveloped from head to foot in the big Turkish
      towel. He was soon dry, and as he stood, his soft skin flushed as
      delicately pink as the inside of a sea-shell, Galt, making many an awkward
      mistake, proceeded to dress him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now let me brush your hair; at least, I know how to do that, young man,&rdquo;
       the father said, &ldquo;but I think it ought to be wet more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no; it is too wet now!&rdquo; the child declared, as he shook his locks, the
      ends of which had been under water. &ldquo;My mother combs it dry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, how will that do, Miss Particular?&rdquo; Galt asked as he led the child
      to a large mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know; it looks funny, somehow&rdquo;&mdash;Lionel made a grimace at his
      image in the glass&mdash;&ldquo;but it will have to do. I'd better hurry home.
      They might miss me, and find out about the fight. I like you for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo; Galt followed him to the door, and as they started across the
      grass toward the cottage he felt Lionel timidly reaching out for his hand.
      He had evidently not heard Galt's half-whispered question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it you said you liked me for?&rdquo; his father repeated, taking the
      little hand and holding it tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, because you wanted me to whip him. He's rich and has everything, and
      Granny says his father is a great man. I suppose if you liked Grover the
      best you would have told <i>him</i> how to fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are smaller than he,&rdquo; Galt said, lamely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it <i>wasn't</i> because you like me?&rdquo; Galt felt the little hand
      stiffen, as if some impulse of dormant confidence in the tiny palm had
      forsaken it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was because I like you,&rdquo; Galt said, warmly, and, obeying a desire
      he refused to combat, he raised the boy in his arms and held him tight
      against his breast. &ldquo;If he had hurt you, Lionel, I don't know what I
      should have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'm glad I made him bellow,&rdquo; the boy said, with a little laugh, as
      he got down to the ground. &ldquo;Something had to be done, you know, after he
      said that about my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, something had to be done, Kenneth Galt told his tortured inner self,
      as he stood and watched the boy trip lightly homeward&mdash;some one had
      to fight and struggle and smart as a consequence of the wrong that had
      been done, and the duty had fallen on a little child. Through the slow,
      weary years of perhaps a long life the fight just beginning would go on,
      and the chief cause of it must shirk it all. Galt groaned, and clinched
      his hands, and turned back to his desolate home. He had contended that
      there was no such thing as spirit, and yet this remorse raging like a
      tempest within him certainly had naught to do with matter. He had argued
      that man, born of the flesh, could gratify all animal desires and suffer no
      ill effects except those excited by physical fear; but there was nothing
      to fear in this case. Dora's lips were sealed; no one else knew the truth,
      or ever would know, and yet the very skies above seemed turning to adamant
      and closing in around him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>ORA BARRY sat at
      her easel absorbed in the painting of a picture, though the afternoon
      light was fading from her canvas in a way that made the work difficult,
      when her mother came to the door and glanced in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have kept a lookout for fully an hour,&rdquo; she announced, &ldquo;but I haven't
      once seen Lionel. I am getting old and silly, I suppose, but I can't keep
      from worrying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dora got up quickly, her face full of alarm, and the two went to the
      window of the dining-room and stood looking out for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! Isn't that&mdash;I see him!&rdquo; Mrs. Barry cried out in relief. &ldquo;Why,
      he is with Kenneth Galt! He has him in his arms. There!&mdash;don't you
      see?&mdash;just beyond the row of cedars. Thank Heaven! we had our scare
      for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Dora, wide-eyed and astonished, was silent; her face was very grave.
      Her mother ran eagerly to the door to meet the child, but Dora remained as
      if rooted to the spot, her gaze fixed on the receding form of Galt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did he have him?&rdquo; she whispered to herself. &ldquo;What can it mean? He was
      treating him kindly, and gently, too. I could see it in his face. It was
      glowing as it used to glow when he was true to himself and to me. It
      looked like Lionel's arm was round his neck. What can it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the child had come in, Dora sat down and drew him into her lap and
      held him fondly to her breast. &ldquo;Mother was frightened,&rdquo; she said,
      cooingly, her lips on his brow. &ldquo;She missed her little boy, and was afraid
      something had happened to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm all right, mother,&rdquo; Lionel said. &ldquo;I can take care of myself; you
      must never be afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did you happen to be with Mr. Galt?&rdquo; Mrs. Barry asked. &ldquo;I didn't
      know you knew him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, why&mdash;&rdquo; but Lionel went no further. He had never lied, and the
      plan his sense of honor had laid for him was difficult to execute. His
      grandmother repeated her question in more positive tones, but, with eyes
      downcast, he refused to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him alone, mother,&rdquo; Dora said, her face rigid. &ldquo;It doesn't make any
      difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't, eh?&rdquo; the old woman exclaimed, in surprise. &ldquo;Well, I think you
      both are acting queerly. There is no reason why Lionel should not tell us
      when and how he met Mr. Galt. I can see by his face that he is keeping
      something back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Dora was holding the child's head against her throbbing breast, and
      she threw an almost commanding glance at her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him alone now,&rdquo; she said, firmly, and with such a sharp tone of
      finality that her mother stared at her in surprise and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Dora prepared the child for bed. As she undressed him she
      scanned each piece of his clothing most carefully. She found a green
      smudge made from strong pressure against the turf in a most unexpected
      place, high up on the child's back; she discovered the imprint of soiled
      fingers on the broad white collar, and remarked the inconsistency of this
      with Lionel's immaculately clean hands; the necktie had been loose and
      awkwardly retied; and, most conspicuous of all, was the uncouth way the
      golden hair was dressed. She noted all these things without comment; but
      when the white bed-covers were turned down, and Lionel had said his
      prayers and crawled in, Dora lowered the lamp and reclined beside him.
      Outwardly she was calm. To the child's observation, no new thing had
      happened in her even life, and yet her whole being was aflame, her soul
      panting in suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother's little boy never has told her a story in all his life,&rdquo; she
      began, as soothingly as if she were crooning him to sleep. &ldquo;Isn't that
      nice? <i>Some</i> little boys tell fibs to their mothers, but <i>my</i>
      boy has always told the truth, and mother is so glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lionel lay still. She kissed him softly and waited. At any other time his
      little arms and lips would have responded, and she marked well the change
      to-night. Lionel did not move or speak, but simply lay with his old-young
      gaze gravely fixed on the ceiling where the lamp-chimney had focussed a
      ring of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would tell <i>your</i> mother everything that ever happened to you,
      wouldn't you, darling?&rdquo; she said, shyly pressing her cheek against his.
      She felt him nod impulsively, but second thought seemed to seal his lips.
      His was a tender age at which to begin the defence of a wronged parent by
      pretext and concealment, but the burden was on his shoulders, and little
      Lionel was manfully doing his best.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two kinds of stories, and they are both bad,&rdquo; Dora went on,
      desperate over the delay of the divulgence which she thought could mean so
      little to the child and yet so very much to her. &ldquo;It is bad to tell a lie,
      and it is bad to keep back anything at all from your mother, because she
      is more to you than all the rest of the world. She is your <i>mother</i>;
      she works for you; she loves you; she would die for you; and if anybody&mdash;no
      matter who it is&mdash;were to want you to keep a secret from her, it
      would be wrong&mdash;very, very wrong. It would make your mother very
      unhappy; it would make her cry long after you were asleep to know that her
      little son was keeping anything from her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt the little white-robed figure quiver. He raised himself on his
      elbow and slowly sat up; his young face, in the dim light, was full of
      struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so, mother?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, darling,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;There can be no secrets at all between a
      mother and her boy. She must tell <i>him</i> everything, and he must not
      keep a thing back from <i>her</i>. How did you happen to meet&mdash;Mr.
      Galt this afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>That's</i> what you want to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear&mdash;that's all. Surely, there can be no reason why your own
      dear mother should not know a little thing like that. Surely he&mdash;Mr.
      Galt&mdash;couldn't have told you not to tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child was still for a moment. He folded his little arms over his knee,
      clinched his hands, and sat avoiding her insistent eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he said, finally. &ldquo;I want to go to Granny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to go to Granny, and leave your mother?&rdquo; she asked, deeply
      perplexed. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a minute,&rdquo; he said, as he crawled over her and got down on the
      floor. &ldquo;I'll be back. I'll be right back, mother, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is something you will tell her, but can't tell me!&rdquo; Dora cried out, in
      half-assumed reproach. &ldquo;Why, <i>Lionel?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be back,&rdquo; he said, evasively. &ldquo;There is no hurry.&rdquo; And she heard the
      patter of his bare feet along the corridor to his grandmother's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Barry always retired early, and she was now in her bed, but very wide
      awake. Something in the incident had set her to thinking on new lines.
      &ldquo;Can it be? Can it be?&rdquo; she kept asking herself, in great excitement. &ldquo;Why
      didn't I think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granny!&rdquo; she heard Lionel call out from the dark, doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear, what is it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to come to your bed a minute&mdash;just a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, come on, darling; don't stumble over anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She heard him groping through the dark, and then felt his little hands on
      her wrinkled face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granny,&rdquo; he said, a tremor in his voice, &ldquo;you told me if anybody ever
      said anything mean about my mother, that I must not let her know about it&mdash;never
      at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, darling, that would be a nice, brave little man, for you wouldn't
      want to make her sad, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I had a terrible fight with Grover Weston over in Mr. Galt's yard.
      Grover said a nasty, mean thing about her. You told me not to let her know
      anything like that, and so did Mr. Galt, but mamma is begging me so hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; The old woman lifted the boy over her into the bed, and put her arms
      about him tenderly. &ldquo;You can tell Granny about it, and then if she thinks
      best perhaps you may tell your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He complied, and the wondering old woman, as she lay with the child in her
      arms, heard the whole beautiful story in every detail, even to Galt's
      display of affection, and as she listened cold tears welled up in her old
      eyes and trickled down the furrows of her cheeks to her pillow. When it
      was over, she led the child back to his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't ask him any more about it. Wait,&rdquo; she said, in an undertone, and
      with a significant gesture in the direction of her room. &ldquo;Don't spoil a
      beautiful thing. God bless him! he is right&mdash;young as he is, he is
      right! The very angels of heaven are closing his sweet lips to-night.
      Don't bother him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Lionel was asleep Dora anxiously crept into her mother's room. A lamp
      was now burning on a table, but Dora blew it out, and went and sat on the
      edge of her mother's bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know your secret now,&rdquo; Mrs. Barry faltered, with a suppressed sob in
      her pillow. &ldquo;All these years I have wondered over your great trouble, and
      why you were not more open with me about it, but Lionel has made it clear.
      I understand now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Kenneth Galt tell my child that&mdash;&rdquo; Dora cried out, in a rasping
      undertone. &ldquo;Did he dare to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, not that!&rdquo; the old woman corrected. &ldquo;He simply betrayed himself
      in his conduct toward the boy. Listen! Lionel need never suspect that you
      know what he did, but you must be told the truth. It is too beautiful for
      you to miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She told the whole story as it had come from the child's lips, together
      with other things she had culled as to happenings between him and his
      father on former occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them both alone,&rdquo; she added, fervently, as she concluded. &ldquo;The little
      fellow, nameless and cast out as he is, has of himself won the love God
      gave him the right to. It is his. Let him keep it, and I pray Heaven that
      it may drag that haughty spirit down into the mire of repentance. I've
      thought it all over. I remember the date well. I know now why he deserted
      you; he couldn't face public exposure just at that particular time. His
      temptation was great, and he fell. I believe he loved you <i>then</i>, and
      that he does <i>yet</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Does yet!</i>&rdquo; Dora sneered, and she put a protesting hand out to her
      mother's as it lay on the coverlet. &ldquo;Don't say that. He couldn't now&mdash;after
      all this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he <i>does</i>, he does&mdash;a thousand times more than he did,
      too,&rdquo; the old woman insisted. &ldquo;He hasn't married; he is leading a lonely,
      morbid life. He-is longing for you&mdash;though he may still dread public
      opinion&mdash;and is adoring the child. He may resist longer, but in the
      end he will succumb and crawl to your feet and beg for forgiveness. Watch
      my prophecy. He'll do it!&mdash;he'll do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know, mother,&rdquo; Dora sighed, and she stood up and moved away in
      the darkness. &ldquo;You don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dora went back to her room and stood looking down at her sleeping child.
      Suddenly her eyes filled and her breast heaved high.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother's little champion!&rdquo; she cried, and she knelt down by the bed,
      covered her face, and wept.

      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE July sun beat
      fiercely on the tin slate roofs of the houses forming square of Stafford.
      It was noon, business was at a standstill. The clerks and typewriters in
      Walton's bank yawning and fanning themselves heat. The only occupied
      individual in the building was the banker himself, who was crouched over
      his desk in his little office making calculations on a pad of paper with a
      pencil. Toby Lassiter was at the window of the receiving-teller when an
      old man came in at the folding-screen door and asked if he might see Mr.
      Walton personally. It was Stephen Whipple, and he carried a travelling-bag
      in his hand; he was covered with dust, and marked in the creases of his
      face by drifts of fine cinders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see, sir, if you'll wait a minute,&rdquo; Toby answered, with his best
      window-manners; then he went to his employer, and returned to pilot the
      caller back to the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stranded on a trip and wants a check cashed without identification,&rdquo; was
      Toby's mental comment as he led the way. &ldquo;Well, he's come to the wrong
      man, as he will mighty soon find out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whipple gave a searching glance at the man who was rising from the desk
      with impatiently lifted brows. He put his bag down at his feet, but failed
      to extend his hand, as Walton evidently expected him to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a seat, sir, take a seat,&rdquo; and the banker motioned to a chair near
      the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; The Westerner kicked his bag along toward the chair, and sat
      down rather clumsily. He took out an enormous handkerchief, also
      considerably begrimed, and mopped his perspiring face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got a hot town, sir,&rdquo; Whipple said, introductively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some say so, and some say not,&rdquo; Walton replied, succinctly. &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo;
       he continued, &ldquo;is there anything I can do for you? The reason I make so
      bold as to ask is because my clerk said you wanted to see me <i>personally</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is of a sort of personal nature; at least, I reckon, you might
      call it that,&rdquo; and the merchant reached down and caught the handle of his
      bag for no obvious reason than that he wanted to move it to a point
      equidistant between his two splaying feet. Then he looked up, and there
      was a decided flush of embarrassment in his face, which extended down to
      the soiled collar on his pudgy neck. The banker, ever quick at the reading
      of countenances, came to the conclusion that some sort of unbusiness-like
      request in regard to needed funds was forthcoming, and he was already
      framing his refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir&mdash;well, sir?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth of the matter is that it is of <i>such</i> a personal nature
      that it is purty hard to know how to get started at it,&rdquo; Whipple finally
      got out. &ldquo;Of course, I am a stranger to you, and I've come, too, without
      any letters of introduction or papers of identification, and&mdash;is
      there any danger of anybody listening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None whatever&mdash;none on earth!&rdquo; Walton sniffed, impatiently. &ldquo;You can
      talk at the top of your voice if you want to; the walls are thick;
      besides, I don't have secrets, and I don't know as I am in the market for
      any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not, Mr. Walton.&rdquo; The flush in the visitor's face was dying
      out and giving place to an expression of rather anxious rigidity. &ldquo;Well, I
      am glad we won't be overheard, at any rate, for I want to talk to you in
      behalf of your son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's it, huh? I see! I see!&rdquo; And Walton swept the form before him
      with eyes in which the lights of anger were slowly but positively
      kindling. &ldquo;It is about him, is it? Well, wait till I send this letter to
      the mail. I'll be back, sir. I'll be back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Mr. Walton. There's no hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the letter in his hand the banker rose as if from the sheer heat of
      the growing anger within him and went out. Standing in the door of the
      main counting-room he caught Lassiter's eye and signalled him to approach.
      Giving him the letter, Walton said: &ldquo;Mail that, and then come back and
      keep a peeled eye on that fat chap at my desk. Do you remember what I said
      when that three thousand dollars came from nowhere in particular by
      express awhile back, along with the mealy-mouthed yarn from Fred about
      changing his ways, and all that gush?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I think so,&rdquo; answered the startled Toby. &ldquo;You said you thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That it was a deep-laid plan amongst him and some other sharpers to
      hoodwink me; and I told you, Toby, that I'd be willing to bet money that
      it wouldn't be many days before somebody would hike along this way to talk
      it over&mdash;some go-between, you understand. Well, he's in there now,
      setting humped over his satchel like a spider watching a fly. He thinks
      I'm the fly. I want to know what he's got to say. I want to see his hand,
      you know, and I come out here to take a whiff of air and steady myself so
      I wouldn't blurt out what I thought too quick and drive him away. Keep
      your eye on him after he leaves me, Toby, and see which way he goes. He
      looks to me like some shyster lawyer who has taken up the matter and
      thinks he is smart enough to fool me. Somebody has invested three thousand
      in this scheme, and the deal is to be clinched this morning. Huh! I'll
      sorter tote 'im along, Toby, and see if I can get onto his game,&rdquo; and,
      with a sly and yet nervous wink, Walton turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; all right now, sir,&rdquo; he said, breezily, as he returned to his
      desk and lowered himself into his chair. &ldquo;We've got this room all to
      ourselves, and are as snug as a bug in a rug, as the fellow said. Now,
      fire ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, it must be a sort o' disagreeable subject for you to talk
      about,&rdquo; Whipple began, awkwardly, &ldquo;and I'll admit to you, Mr. Walton, that
      I thought over it a powerful long time before I finally made up my mind to
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, of course,&rdquo; Walton said, pulling his whiskers with his long hand&mdash;&ldquo;of
      course, you naturally would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Especially as Fred had no idea of what I had in view,&rdquo; the Westerner
      said. &ldquo;You see, I had to act wholly on my own responsibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see&mdash;I see, sir.&rdquo; It was only by an effort that Walton kept a
      sarcastic ring of irritation out of his voice, and he stroked into the
      roots of his beard a smile of contempt at such puerile attempts to
      deceive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that's what makes the whole thing so hard on me,&rdquo; the merchant went
      on. &ldquo;You see, I took it on myself to act for Fred in, I might say, actual
      opposition to his wishes and judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whipple then proceeded to give a full and accurate account of his first
      introduction to Fred and all that had happened to him since, withholding
      only his own name and the name of the town he was from. And while he
      talked, pausing to wipe his wet brow at times, or to clear his shaky
      voice, the banker watched him as a cat might a mouse. He held a pencil in
      his long, steady fingers, and kept the point of it on a pad of paper,
      raising his shrewd glance and lowering it as suited his fancy. Had he been
      an artist, old Simon might have sketched what to his understanding was the
      most subtly designing face he had ever seen. Here was a man, he told
      himself, who resorted even to the emotional methods of a ranting
      revivalist to gain his nefarious aims. It was a wonderful conception, but
      it wofully missed its mark, for it was being applied to a man who had no
      emotions. It was being applied to a man, too, who was as eagerly on the
      lookout for new tricks as a biologist for a new species of insect. What a
      weakling the fellow was, for a man of that age, and what fun it would be
      to suddenly undeceive him&mdash;let him know the manner of man he was
      attempting, in such a shallow way, to bunco!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I decided not to wait longer,&rdquo; Whipple concluded, with a sigh. &ldquo;I
      didn't intend to act till the remaining three thousand was paid; but, as I
      say, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only two, according to my calculations.&rdquo; Walton thought he had
      tripped him up, and smiled knowingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fred said he felt that another thousand, at least, was due as interest at
      the rate you usually get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see; he's certainly liberal.&rdquo; Walton smiled at his joke, and bent
      his head over his pad to hide it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I say,&rdquo; the merchant resumed, &ldquo;I intended to wait till the debt was
      entirely paid, but things took a sudden turn that I didn't expect. I
      offered to advance the money to Fred, but he wouldn't take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he wouldn't take it!&rdquo; Walton said, with a hurried regret that Toby
      was not present to enjoy the feast of stupidity being spread before him.
      &ldquo;I see; he didn't want it. That's a little bit like him.&rdquo; Simon's
      amusement showed itself now in his voice rather than in the visage which
      he managed to keep unruffled. &ldquo;But you say things had sorter taken a twist
      around?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he was brave enough, and bearing up mighty well till me and him took
      a trip, as much for pleasure as anything else, to New York, and we passed
      through this very town, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you passed through here?&rdquo; Walton interrupted, and then to himself he
      added: &ldquo;I knew it. I knew Fred was hanging about Atlanta and sending money
      to that woman. Huh, his fat agent is certainly giving the snap away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we passed through here one night, and, as our train was delayed
      below town by a wreck ahead of us, Fred got out and walked around. He was
      gone till after midnight, and when he came back to the Pullman where I was
      I noticed that he was powerfully upset, and begun to suspect that maybe
      this was his old home. He started to tell me about it then, but I stopped
      him, and it was not till we had been to New York and got back home that he
      finally told me your name and where you lived. As I said, he has not been
      the same since then, and, to be honest with you, Mr. Walton, I don't know
      of anything in the world that will restore his peace of mind, except&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except having me send for him,&rdquo; Simon suddenly let himself go, &ldquo;and kill
      the fatted bull-yearling, and put a dinky-dinky cap on his brow, and give
      him a key to the vault, and start in, hit or miss, exactly where me and
      him left off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are hard on him, Mr. Walton,&rdquo; Whipple gasped, fairly staggered by the
      unexpected retort&mdash;&ldquo;much harder, I must say, than I had hoped to find
      you. He declared that you wasn't the sort that would forgive easily, but,
      having been a father once myself, I didn't believe you would, after
      hearing about your boy's life since he left you, refuse to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here!&rdquo; Walton interrupted, laying down his pencil and staring at the
      visitor from eyes which fairly snapped with blended triumph and rage,
      &ldquo;you've held the floor long enough; now step aside and let me take it. I
      don't know as I ever had the luck to run across just such a specimen as
      you are. You've evidently had very little to do with <i>business</i> men.
      You seem to have as little common sense as a mountain school-teacher or a
      young preacher on his first circuit. Here you come with a long,
      roundabout, hatched-up tale that is so thin and full of holes that a body
      could throw a straw hat through it. I'd have you understand that this here
      house is a <i>bank</i>. My own granddaddy would have to be identified, if
      he was alive, before he could cash a check at that front window, and yet
      here you come&mdash;pitapat, pitapat, as unconcerned as a house-cat
      looking for a place to lie down&mdash;back into my private quarters, and
      propose something that may, or may not, involve every dollar I own on the
      top-side of the earth. You do all that without even taking the trouble to
      hint at who you are or where you hail from, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not afraid to give you my name!&rdquo; the merchant gasped, taken wholly
      off his guard by the withering attack. &ldquo;It is Stephen Whipple, sir&mdash;W-h-i-double
      p-l-e, Whipple!&rdquo; he spelled, and he leaned forward and pointed a stiff
      finger at Walton's pad. &ldquo;Write it down. It might get away from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you plumb sure it ain't <i>Jenkins?</i>&rdquo; the banker grinned,
      significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; nor Jones, nor Smith, nor Brown. It's Whipple&mdash;Stephen Whipple.
      Put it down on your paper. Huh, I'm not ashamed of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, there you are, in big letters.&rdquo; Walton laughed, still
      victoriously, as he pencilled the name on the pad. &ldquo;Now, one other
      formality, please&mdash;your postoffice address?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My post-office&mdash;&rdquo; Whipple hesitated. His astounded gaze went down;
      he was all of a quiver, even to his bushy eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it's this way&mdash;this way&mdash;&rdquo; he stammered, and, raising his
      helpless eyes to the banker's taunting ones, he came to a dead halt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it <i>must</i> be,&rdquo; Walton chuckled. &ldquo;In fact, it mighty nigh
      always is that way when a feller gits in a corner. But surely, out of all
      the places in the United States, you could think of <i>some</i> town,
      railroad station, or cross-roads store. A word as uncommon as <i>Whipple</i>
      would be hard for <i>me</i> to think of in a pinch. It seemed to come
      handy to you. Maybe you've used it before, or had some dead friend by that
      name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not fair, sir!&rdquo; The merchant was becoming exasperated by the
      human riddle before him. &ldquo;I told you I had come against your son's
      knowledge or wish. He has kept his whereabouts from you up to now, and I
      have no moral right to let it out. I reckon he is afraid you will hound
      him down before he has a chance to pay back what he owes you. The Lord
      knows, he has plenty of reason for being cautious, for, if I am any judge,
      you are as hard and unforgiving as a stone wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't seen any reason to forgive him, or bother one way or another
      about it,&rdquo; old Simon hurled into the flushed face before him. &ldquo;I don't see
      any difference between the way me and him stand now and six years ago. I
      reckon he thinks I'm on my last legs, and that the three thousand he got
      by some hook or crook&mdash;or <i>from</i> some crook&mdash;would be well
      invested as a gum-stickum plaster to put over my eyes before I am put
      under ground. After he had staked that much, he thought some oily-tongued
      friend of his might come and reconnoitre and report favorable. Well,
      you've reconnoitred, Mr.&mdash;Mr. Whipstock, and you can go back to
      Atlanta and tell him it is no go. You may tell him I am much obliged to you
      all&mdash;whoever your gang is&mdash;for the three thousand on account. I
      may be making a mistake now by shooting off my mouth so quick, for if I
      had worked my cards right I might have secured another payment by dropping
      a tear or two; but it is worth something to say what I've said in the way
      I've said it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you don't believe what I have told you?&rdquo; Whipple gasped, in
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a blessed word&mdash;not a syllable,&rdquo; Walton laughed, and he threw
      himself back in his chair in sheer enjoyment of his visitor's
      discomfiture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't believe he is in my employment&mdash;you don't believe he
      earned the money by faithful work which he sent you&mdash;you don't
      believe&mdash;&rdquo; Whipple paused, at the end of his resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't believe even <i>that</i>,&rdquo; Walton jested. &ldquo;But I'll tell you
      one thing, and I mean it. I don't intend to have you coming around
      bothering me with this matter any more at all. It is strictly my affair,
      anyway. That boy was a bad egg when he was here, and from the looks of you
      and your game I can't see that he has improved a dang bit. I don't say I'd
      arrest him, neither; half the debt has been paid, if it <i>was</i> paid
      for a sneaking reason, and he can rove where he will. He is a good
      riddance. I used to bother about what might become of him, but I don't
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, look me in the eye!&rdquo; Whipple suddenly demanded, and with a
      fierceness that almost sent a shock of surprise through the banker.
      &ldquo;You've not believed what I have told you, it seems, because you thought I
      was after your dirty money. Hard cash is the only thing you <i>can</i>
      believe in, I see, and so I am going to use some of it to convince you.
      You have no faith in your son&mdash;the only child God gave you, and who
      is now honoring your gray hairs as they don't deserve to be honored, but,
      thank Heaven! I believe in him from head to foot. Before I left Atlanta,
      this morning, I prepared myself for some sort of emergency like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whipple took out a long envelope and threw it on the desk under the
      banker's eyes. &ldquo;That contains three thousand dollars&mdash;six bills of
      five hundred each. Take them! Your boy's debt is paid in full. I may have
      spoiled his chances with <i>you</i> by coming here against his knowledge,
      but he shall not lose by it. If I live to get back home I shall provide
      for him in my will. I may look like a faker, but I flatter myself&mdash;from
      all I have heard of you&mdash;that I am worth more to-day in the financial
      world than you could be if you could live another twenty-five years.
      Good-day, sir.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>AKING up his
      satchel, the merchant strode heavily from the room. Doubting if he had
      heard aright, Walton tore open the envelope and took out the bills. He
      spread them on the desk; he fumbled them with quivering fingers; he took
      out a big magnifying glass and essayed to examine them one by one, but his
      excitement and perturbation rendered it impossible. Dropping his hand on
      his call-bell, he gave a sharp ring, and Toby Lassiter came in quickly.
      Brushing the money toward his clerk, Walton said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See if they are counterfeit. By gum!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk examined them with the glass while Walton watched him with
      staring eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They seem to me to be all right, Mr. Walton,&rdquo; Toby said, wonderingly, as
      he laid the bills down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon they are&mdash;my Lord, I reckon they are!&rdquo; the banker said, in
      his throat. &ldquo;Credit it on my private account, Toby. Credit me with three&mdash;my
      Lord, I didn't think&mdash;I had no idea that the dang fellow&mdash;no,
      I'll attend to the money. Toby, you run out and see where he goes. He may
      make for a hotel, or he may&mdash;but hurry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Twenty minutes later Toby came back and found Walton still at his desk,
      the money before him; his face had taken on an ashen tinge, the eye he
      raised had a lacklustre expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I missed him for the first few minutes,&rdquo; the clerk said. &ldquo;He was on the
      way to the train. I took the belt-line down. He was on the car ahead. I
      was just in time to see him board the Atlanta special.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he's gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he's gone, Mr. Walton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man stared helplessly for a minute into the puzzled face of his
      clerk, and then he drew the pad to him on which he had written the name of
      his caller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me 'n' him had a tiff,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We had a sort o' tiff&mdash;I reckon
      you might call it that&mdash;after he had told me a long cock-and-bull
      tale about Fred reforming, and I laughed at him. I reckon I was rough.
      Then he threw this money at me all in a chunk to settle off the boy's
      account, and said it might talk plainer than <i>he</i> had. Toby, it don't
      look <i>exactly</i> like a fake. Fakes ain't worked that way. You see, it
      was all up between me and him, and there wasn't a thing he could gain by
      it, and yet he yanked out this wad and threw it at me like so much waste
      paper. He refused to say where he lives, but here's his name. Fred wrote
      that the fellow he was with was a merchant, and a big one at that. I
      wonder if there is any way of finding out just who and what the dang fool
      is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you didn't get his address?&rdquo; Toby inquired, as he helplessly
      stroked his colorless face and sparse mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; The banker uttered something like a moan of self-disgust. &ldquo;He
      intimated that he kept it back to keep me from running the boy down. I
      reckon I made a big fool of myself in the presence of a man that may have
      unlimited capital for all I know. That's where my judgment slipped a cog
      for once, I reckon. I set in to believe he was out after my money, and
      went a little mite over the limit. He didn't <i>look</i> rich, covered
      with dust like he was, but he <i>may</i> be&mdash;he may be all Fred has
      claimed. Can you think of any way, Toby, to get a report on him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might take Bradstreet's by States,&rdquo; the clerk suggested, &ldquo;and run
      through all the towns and cities far and near.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would take a month to go through that big book,&rdquo; Walton said,
      dejectedly, &ldquo;and I want to know to-day, right off. If&mdash;if I've made a
      break as big as that, and&mdash;and gone and insulted a man who has
      befriended my boy, and one who, in fact, says he intends to provide for
      him liberally, why, it would be nothing but good business to make what
      amend lies in my power. If the boy really <i>has</i> built himself up, and
      made good connections, and the like, why, you see, Toby, I ought not to be
      the <i>first</i>&mdash;the very <i>first</i>&mdash;to&mdash;to damage his
      interests. What I said, in my rough way, you see, might have a tendency to
      sort o' make this Whipple&mdash;if he is all right&mdash;think twice
      before helping out the son of a man who rode as high a horse as I was
      astride of just now. I must have a report on him, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go through the book, Mr. Walton,&rdquo; the clerk said. &ldquo;It wouldn't take
      so awful long. I would only have to run through the W's, you know, and
      needn't look in the <i>little</i> places. If he is in the wholesale line,
      he must be in a town of over ten thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a fact, that's a fact,&rdquo; Walton agreed. &ldquo;I reckon he didn't think
      of that when he gave me his name, though I acknowledge I kinder gouged it
      out of him when he was good and hot. Go bring the book here and set at my
      desk. I'll not let the rest bother you. My Lord! my Lord! What a mess!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All that afternoon the clerk bent over the huge volume with its closely
      printed columns on very thin paper. The closing hour came. The typewriters
      and clerks went home and the front door was shut, but still Toby read,
      patiently running the point of his pencil down column after column. Night
      came on, and less than half of the book still remained to be scanned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go home to supper and come back,&rdquo; Walton said, a strange light burning in
      his shrewd eyes. &ldquo;I'll meet you here. I want this thing settled. I don't
      believe I could sleep with the doubt on my mind as to whether that man was
      fooling me or not. It is a big thing&mdash;a powerful big thing. If Fred
      has made himself of enough importance to have a man like that come a long
      distance in his behalf, why, you see, I ought to know about it, that's all&mdash;I
      ought to know about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you ought to know, Mr. Walton,&rdquo; Lassiter said, as he laid a blotter
      between the pages and reached for his hat. They went out together and
      walked side by side to the corner, where the clerk had to turn off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sort o' believed in Fred all along, Toby,&rdquo; the banker said,
      tentatively&mdash;&ldquo;that is, you used to talk him up to some extent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought he was in earnest about what he wrote in that last good-bye
      letter, Mr. Walton. It made a deep impression on me. It sounded perfectly
      straight. And awhile back, when his <i>other</i> letter came, bringing all
      that cash, I was more sure than ever. Even when you said you believed it
      was a trick, somehow I couldn't exactly look at it that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, see if you can locate this Whipple,&rdquo; Walton said, and, turning off,
      he trudged heavily homeward through the gathering shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was on his way back to the bank about nine o'clock when he saw Toby
      coming toward him. The clerk was walking rapidly, swinging his long arms
      to and fro like pendulums.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well?&rdquo; Walton exclaimed, as they met face to face on the sidewalk
      in the flare of a gas-light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have found him!&rdquo; Toby chuckled. &ldquo;There is no mistake. Stephen Whipple
      is a whopping big wholesale grocer at Gate City, Oklahoma. He's rated at
      over a million, with credit at the top notch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say!&rdquo; A negro laborer with a bag of flour on his shoulder was
      passing close by, and Walton laid his hand warmingly on the arm of his
      clerk and drew him slowly along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say!&rdquo; he repeated, under his breath, as he clutched Toby's thin
      arm, &ldquo;and I talked to him like a dog&mdash;like a hound-dog. I did that,
      when he could buy and sell me over and over. I sneered at him, and just as
      good as called him a thief, when he was right then befriending the son I'd
      cast off. Say, Toby, you've got a sight more sense than I have; what do
      you think I ought to do about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don't know, Mr. Walton,&rdquo; Toby replied, awkwardly. &ldquo;Maybe it
      would be a good idea for you to go out there. From the way Fred wrote, it
      stands to reason he'd be glad to see you, anyway, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't do that, Toby,&rdquo; Walton said, under his breath. &ldquo;After the
      stand I took and have held all these years, I couldn't go running after
      him. I could do <i>some</i> things, but I couldn't do that. Besides, you
      see, Whipple would know we'd looked up his standing, and think I'd come
      because he was rich. But, say, I have an idea, Toby. Don't you think you
      could get on the train and go out there and take a look around?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, if you advise it, Mr. Walton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you could go and hang about, in a quiet, know-nothing way, without
      letting Fred see you, I reckon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easy enough, Mr. Walton, in a bustling place like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I'll tell you what you do. Pack your grip to-night, and take
      the eight-thirty train in the morning. Put up at some out-of-the-way
      hotel, and lie low and pick up what information you can. Don't go about
      Whipple's place of business; if Fred saw you, it would spoil it all. I'll
      defray your expenses. You deserve a trip, anyway. Of course, even if the
      boy has made such a good, comfortable nest for himself out there, that
      woman business is still hanging over him, and he wouldn't feel exactly
      like facing Stafford folks right now. But I reckon he's been doing an
      honest man's part by her along with his rise. He's been providing for her
      and the child pretty well, I'll be bound. And in case he <i>does</i> come
      back, even on a visit, we'll help him smooth over the matter as far as is
      in our power. He ain't the first young chap that's let his blood get the
      upper hand. Some of the great men of history have made like slips along at
      the start. Yes, we'll try to manage that some way. We might even get her
      and her mother to move off somewhere. I don't know&mdash;I only say it <i>might</i>
      be done. Folks in a plight of that sort will do most anything when they
      are paid, and it looks like Fred won't go a-begging. Now, good-bye, Toby.
      You've got a job of detective work before you, but I believe you'll be
      smart enough to put it through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do my best, Mr. Walton,&rdquo; the clerk said. &ldquo;Goodbye.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was a
      delightfully cool and crisp morning for midsummer, and Doctor Dearing was
      on the lawn between his house and Galt's, when he noticed that the
      railroad president had come out into his own grounds for a smoke. The two
      exchanged greetings through cordial signals, and Galt crossed over and
      joined his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What news from New York?&rdquo; he asked, as he flicked the ashes from his
      cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will be here to-morrow,&rdquo; Dearing replied. &ldquo;Madge has been homesick
      for fully two weeks; but Uncle Tom made her stay longer, hoping that she
      would become more interested in what was going on. They have had all sorts
      of attentions paid them, but he writes me that he has never been worried
      so much in his life over her. He says she enjoyed the first two weeks
      thoroughly, but lately she has been actually depressed. He tried
      everything imaginable, but home was what she wanted and would have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so they are coming?&rdquo; Galt said, reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they are on the way now. After all, what better could one ask for
      than a snug retreat like this in hot weather? Madge is fond of home. She
      doesn't care for giddy social things among a lot of money-spending
      Yankees, and I admire her taste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so do I,&rdquo; Galt answered, and he smoked steadily, his eyes bent on
      the ground. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an unpleasant job on hand,&rdquo; Dearing remarked. &ldquo;I have delayed it
      several times, but I have decided to do it to-day and have it over with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Galt asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a slight operation I have to perform on little Lionel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Operation? Lionel?&rdquo; Galt started, and then checked himself and stared
      blankly. &ldquo;I didn't know there was anything at all wrong with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is only a slight and common thing with children,&rdquo; Dearing
      explained. &ldquo;Enlarged tonsils and adenoidal growth which must be removed.
      Outwardly the little chap is as sound as a dollar, and, so far, his
      wonderful strength has fought the thing off; but for a child so nervous as
      he is, and high strung and imaginative, it might, later on affect him
      seriously. Neglected cases have brought on permanent deafness and lung
      trouble. It is inherited, as a rule; you, <i>yourself</i>, had something
      of that sort, I think you told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Galt replied. Deep down within him something seemed to clutch
      his vitals. In the ear of his naked soul an accusing voice was sounding:
      &ldquo;Inherited! Inherited!&rdquo; The word rang out like a threat from the Infinite&mdash;from
      the vast mystery of life which had of late been so tenaciously closing
      around him. Even the pain Lionel was to undergo was the outcome of
      another's sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is a very simple operation,&rdquo; Dearing went on, &ldquo;and in any ordinary
      case I shouldn't give it a second thought; but, by George, I have become
      attached to that little chap. He is the pluckiest little man I ever knew.
      I had an exhibition of his grit one day that was ahead of anything I ever
      saw in a child. He had fallen, and his upper teeth had cut a deep gash in
      his tongue. They sent for me, and I saw that I'd have to take a stitch in
      it to close the ugly gap. It was a ticklish job, and I hardly saw how I
      could do it, for I didn't want to use an anaesthetic. But I talked to him
      just as I would to a man, and he promised me he wouldn't cry. He didn't. I
      give you my word, old man, he didn't whimper as the needle went through,
      and even while I was tying the thread; but I could see from his big,
      strained eyes that it hurt him like rips. A child with grit like that,
      Kenneth, is bound to make a stir in the world. I have noticed that you
      like him too, and I am glad you do. The truth is, darn you, you are taking
      my place! I'm jealous; he thinks you are a regular king. He is always
      talking about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you think you will do the&mdash;the operation?&rdquo; Galt faltered, as
      he averted his shrinking glance from Dearing's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I want to do it right off. It is like this: his mother knows it has
      to be done, and has agreed to leave it entirely to me; but she is very
      nervous over it. She has a vein of morbid superstition running through
      her. She fancies that some disaster is bound, sooner or later, to happen
      to him&mdash;in fact, as she has often put it to me, she hardly believes
      that a just God would allow such a sensitive and ambitious child to grow
      up to a full comprehension of his humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see&mdash;I see what you mean,&rdquo; Galt managed to say, and his soul
      seemed to writhe anew as he stood trying to make his words sound casual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I thought,&rdquo; the doctor went on, &ldquo;that I'd like, if possible, to get it
      over without her knowledge, or without her mother knowing of it. Nervous
      people standing around, half frightened out of their wits, at such a time,
      unsteady my hand and upset me generally. Now, as I have everything in
      readiness up-stairs, I think, when Lionel comes over this morning, as I've
      asked him to do, I'll talk him into it. Young Doctor Beaman, my new
      assistant, is up-stairs sterilizing my instruments, and he will give the
      chloroform. You see, it would be a pleasant surprise and a relief to those
      doting women to suddenly find out that the thing they have made such a
      fuss about is over and no harm done.&rdquo; Galt made no reply. He had seen a
      trim little figure darting across the lower end of the lawn, and saw a
      flash of golden tresses in the sunlight, and knew that Lionel was coming&mdash;and
      to what? Galt suppressed an inward groan. The unsuspecting child was
      bounding along, joyous and full of life, to the grim, inexplicable snare
      which had been set for him. Young as he was, he was to be asked to be firm
      and brave, that his little form might take on the semblance of death and
      submit to the knife, a thing at the thought of which even strong men had
      quailed. And what might, after all, be the as yet unrevealed outcome? One
      case in every ten thousand, at least, failed to survive the artificial
      sleep, owing to this or that overlooked internal defect. Would this child
      of malignant misfortune be that one?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lionel drew near, sweeping the two men with merry eyes of welcome. There
      was an instant's hesitation as to which to greet first, and then instinct
      seemed to swerve him toward Galt, his hand outstretched. With a queer
      throb of appreciation, the father took it and felt it pulsate in his
      clasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, Lionel, my boy,&rdquo; Dearing said, with affected lightness of
      manner. &ldquo;You remember what I said one day about those ugly lumps down
      there in your little throat which are going to get bigger and bigger, till
      after a while you can't eat any jam and cake? You wouldn't like that,
      would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember.&rdquo; Lionel passed his tapering hand over his white throat. &ldquo;I
      can feel them when I swallow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is why you have those bad dreams, and jump in your sleep, and
      think you are falling,&rdquo; Dearing added, adroitly. &ldquo;You know you promised to
      let me get them out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not to-day!&rdquo; the boy protested, throwing a wistful glance up at the
      unclouded sky. &ldquo;I was going to build a really-really house out of the
      bricks at the barn. I have a stove-pipe for a smoke-stack. I'll show you
      both. Come with me! Oh, it's great!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-day. Lionel, listen.&rdquo; Dearing drew the boy close to him, and
      tenderly stroked back his hair from his fine brow. &ldquo;Mamma, you know, is
      terribly nervous about it. <i>Women</i> are that way, aren't they? Men and
      boys, like us, know better. She can hardly sleep at night for thinking
      about it&mdash;even a little thing like that. We can do it now, and I can
      run over and tell her you are sleeping like a kitten in my big bed
      up-stairs, and she and Granny will be so glad. It won't hurt a bit, you
      know, for the medicine will make you sleep through it all.&rdquo; A shadow of
      deep disappointment came into Lionel's expressive eyes. The warm color of
      life in his face faded into tense gravity, and they saw him clasp his
      little hands and wring them undecidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think to-day is the best time?&rdquo; he faltered, on the edge of
      refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very best of all, Lionel,&rdquo; Dearing said, gently. &ldquo;You wouldn't be
      afraid of me, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child stared dumbly. To Galt's accusing sense the world had never held
      a more desolate sentient being than this incipient repetition of himself.
      The child had proved that he knew no physical fear. To what, then, did he
      owe this evident clutch of horror? Could it be due to some psychic warning
      of approaching danger, or was the sensitive child telepathically governed
      by the morbid fears which, at that moment, were raging in the heart of his
      father?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, that's a good, nice boy!&rdquo; Dearing urged. &ldquo;I see you are going to be
      a brave little man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not afraid it will <i>hurt</i>,&rdquo; Lionel faltered, &ldquo;but I don't like
      to be put to&mdash;to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it must be so, my boy,&rdquo; the doctor said. &ldquo;Come on. Mamma will see us
      in a minute and smell a mouse.&rdquo; For a moment yet the child stood
      undecided, his gaze alternately on the two faces before him. Suddenly,
      while they waited and his eyes were resting in strange appeal on Galt, he
      asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shock as if from some unknown force went through the man addressed, but,
      seeing no alternative, he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish it, yes, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And <i>you</i> think I ought to&mdash;to do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Galt nodded, his head rocking like that of an automaton. &ldquo;The
      doctor knows best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I'll go,&rdquo; the boy sighed, with another wistful look over the
      lawn. &ldquo;I'll go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they were entering the house, by some strange mandate of fate or
      instinct the boy again took his father's hand, and Galt held it as they
      began to ascend the broad, walnut stairs. Argue as he would that the
      operation was only a most ordinary thing, to Galt's morbid state of mind
      it assumed the shape of a tragedy staged and enacted by the very imps of
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way up the boy tripped on the stair-carpeting and slipped and fell
      face downward. He was unhurt, but Galt raised him in his arms and bore him
      up the remainder of the steps into a big, light room off the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are, Doctor Beaman!&rdquo; Dearing cheerily called out to a slender,
      beardless young man, who, with a towel in hand, was bending over some
      polished instruments on the bureau. &ldquo;This is the little chap who never
      cries when he is hurt. He is a regular soldier, I tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm not afraid,&rdquo; the boy said, as he stood alone in the centre of the
      room; but still, as his father noted, there was a certain contradictory
      rigidity of his features which he had never remarked before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Galt told himself that the child's evident dread, vague as it was, was
      also an inheritance; for he recalled how he himself had once taken ether
      to have a slight operation performed. He had been a man in years at the
      time, and yet the effect on his mind as to what might be the outcome had
      been most depressing. That day, as he was doing now, he had looked upon
      the drug-induced sleep as a dangerous approach to death; and now, as then,
      he gravely feared that the tiny thread of reduced vitality might be torn
      asunder. He stood dumb with accusing horror as the two doctors hastily
      made their grewsome arrangements, such as securing warm water, fresh
      towels and sheets, which, in their very whiteness, suggested a shroud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise made as they drew a narrow table across the resounding floor
      into the best light between the two windows jarred harshly on his tense
      nerves. These things were grim enough, but the wan isolation of the
      waiting child, as he stood with that war against fear and shame of fear
      going on in his great, fathomless eyes, so like those of his artist-mother&mdash;that
      appealing little figure, nameless, disowned among men, was stamped on the
      retina of Galt's eye for the remainder of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, take off your waist and collar and necktie,&rdquo; Dearing said to Lionel&mdash;&ldquo;that
      will be enough. We'll have you all right in a jiffy. You are not afraid <i>now</i>,
      are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galt's heart sank like a plummet, for the child's lips moved, but no sound
      issued. The little fellow turned his face away as he began to undress. He
      removed the flowing necktie, but his little fingers could not unfasten the
      stiff linen collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help him, Kenneth,&rdquo; Dearing said. &ldquo;My hands are full.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galt obeyed, his fingers coming into contact with the cold chin of the
      child and the soft flesh of his neck. He felt like snatching the boy from
      the damnable spot, as a mother might her young from the claws of a wild
      beast. Yet, outwardly calm, he drew the sleeves of the child's blouse off
      and laid it on a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we are ready for you, young man,&rdquo; Dearing said, lightly. &ldquo;I see you
      are not afraid I'll hurt you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I know it won't <i>hurt</i>,&rdquo; Lionel said, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you begin butting me,&rdquo; Dearing laughed. &ldquo;You are not a goat like
      the one that butted Grover Weston heels over head the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I shouldn't wake up&mdash;I mean if I really <i>shouldn't</i>, you
      know,&rdquo; Lionel finished, with a faint effort to smile at the doctor's jest,
      &ldquo;won't you please not tell my mother too quick? She gets frightened so
      easily, and, you see, if I didn't wake up&mdash;if I never woke again&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, come off!&rdquo; Dearing laughed, as he turned to his assistant. &ldquo;Doctor,
      this kid hints that we don't know our business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I didn't wake, if I <i>didn't!</i>&rdquo; Lionel insisted, &ldquo;you'd not
      scare her, would you? And&mdash;and&rdquo;&mdash;his lower lip quivered&mdash;&ldquo;wouldn't
      you tell her that I wasn't a bit afraid, and that I didn't cry, and&mdash;wait!
      wait! Won't you tell her that it didn't hurt a single bit, not even a
      little <i>teensy bit?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Dearing said, and, considerably taken aback, he stared at Galt
      rather than at the insistent speaker. &ldquo;I'll tell her you are the best boy
      in the world&mdash;the best, the bravest, and the sweetest. And God knows
      I'll mean it,&rdquo; he finished, in a lower tone to Galt. &ldquo;I've seen thousands
      of kids, Kenneth, but this one gets nearer me than all the rest put
      together. I swear I am almost tempted to throw the darn job up. But, you
      see, it has to be done. Doctor,&rdquo; turning to his assistant, &ldquo;put him on the
      table, and I'll tickle his nose and make him laugh. We'll make him have
      the funniest dreams he ever had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Beaman went to the boy and held out his arms, and Lionel was lifted
      to the table and stretched out on the crisp sheet which had been spread
      over it. Just then, happening to look round, Dearing saw Galt's face, and
      hastily stepped to his side. &ldquo;My Lord!&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I see this thing is
      going against you, old man. You are nauseated; you look faint. Many men
      are that way&mdash;young students sometimes have to give up surgery for
      that reason. It is nothing to be ashamed of. You like the little chap, and
      your sympathies are worked up, that's all. But, really, I don't think you
      ought to stay. I become nervous if others are, and I must have a free
      hand. Besides, if you were to keel over in a faint at an important moment
      I couldn't look after you. You'd better run down-stairs and take a whiff
      of air. I'll call you when it is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he going?&mdash;must he go?&rdquo; Lionel asked, as he turned his head and
      saw Galt moving to the door. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dearing said, &ldquo;but only down-stairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; the child exclaimed, regretfully, and averted his face, &ldquo;I thought
      he could stay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down into the still silence of the great hall Galt went. There was
      something heartlessly maddening in the calm, yellow sunlight on the grass,
      which he could see through the doorway. The birds in the trees, as they
      flitted about with twigs in their mouths and chirped in glee, seemed
      mocking voices of despair from the deliberate tyranny of the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God have mercy and spare him!&rdquo; the man cried out from the depths of his
      agony. &ldquo;Spare him, O God, spare him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unconscious of the incongruous prayer which had fallen from his lips, he
      turned into the drawing-room, on the left of the hall, and sank into an
      easy-chair, covering his face with his stiff hands. Suddenly he heard a
      light step on the veranda, and, raising his eyes, he saw Dora standing in
      the hall, glancing wildly and excitedly about her. Possessed by the fear
      that she might call out, and thus make her presence known at that most
      crucial moment, he rose and hastened to her. She did not see him till he
      was close at her side, and then she turned and their eyes met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Lionel&mdash;where is my child?&rdquo; she panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood staring at her, unable to formulate a reply, and, brushing past
      him with an air of contempt, which he read all too clearly, she turned to
      the stairs, and started to ascend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you mustn't&mdash;you really mustn't!&rdquo; he called out in protest, and
      he put a detaining hand on her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shrinking from his touch, she stared at him piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they really are doing it!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;They are up there operating
      on my child! I knew it when Doctor Beaman drove up, and Doctor Wynn came
      and asked Lionel to play over here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galt made no denial. He stood beside her, swept out of himself by the
      sheer power of her astounding beauty, as he now beheld it for the first
      time since their parting. In his wildest stretch of fancy as to what the
      years might have brought her, he had not dreamed that she had become such
      a flower among women. There was a seductive maturity of intellect in her
      faultless face. The strange, appealing, and yet unreadable lights of
      genius were burning in her dark, mystic eyes. He stood before her with the
      smitten humility, the cringing shame, of a subject rebuked by his queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am sure of it!&rdquo; she moaned, and she lowered her glorious head to
      the newel of the stairs and shuddered. &ldquo;They are cutting my darling, and I
      can't go to him. Doctor Wynn thought he'd spare my feelings&mdash;as if
      that counted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly looked him squarely in the face, and he shrank before the
      calm penetration of her stare. &ldquo;We'll never see him alive again,&rdquo; she
      said, in a low, husky voice&mdash;&ldquo;never again on earth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, don't say that!&rdquo; he cried, finding his submerged voice in the
      agony produced by her suggestion. &ldquo;God wouldn't be so unmerciful&mdash;the
      child has harmed no one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak of God,&rdquo; she suddenly retorted, standing farther from him and
      drawing herself erect. &ldquo;The word was a joke with you once,&rdquo; she added,
      with a bitter sneer. &ldquo;And I believed your puny theories, and blindly
      followed out the deductions you made with your nose in the earth during
      our vain dream of intellectual supremacy. But a change was wrought in me.
      Into my wretched darkness Lionel came, and I saw and was convinced. He was
      my living, pulsating, immortal link to the Infinite. But he is not for the
      earth. He is above it. God allowed Christ to suffer the pangs of a
      material existence for the salvation of the world, but He is too merciful
      to let my sensitive darling face what he would have to face. Lionel was
      sent to lift me, with his tiny hands, from the slough into which I had
      fallen, but his mission is over&mdash;oh, God, it is over! How can I bear
      it&mdash;how can I live without him? He is my life, my <i>soul!</i>&rdquo; She
      covered her tortured face with her bloodless hands and remained still,
      save for the emotion which quivered through her hysterical frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Galt stood gazing at her for a moment, an almost uncontrollable yearning
      on him to clasp her in his arms and beg her forgiveness. He might have
      done so but for the fear of offending her. He glanced up the stairs. How
      still it was above! How like death! In his alarmed fancy he saw the two
      doctors standing aghast over the still, senseless form of his child. They
      had miscalculated! The physical examination had misled them; ether should
      have been the drug employed rather than chloroform!
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncovering her face, Dora read his thoughts. She uttered a low, despairing
      wail, and they stood looking into each other's eyes. There was a sound of
      sudden movement on the floor above. Some one was raising a window-sash at
      the top of the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sweating like an ox!&rdquo; they heard Dearing say; and&mdash;could they
      believe their ears?&mdash;he was actually laughing, and calling out to
      Lionel: &ldquo;I told you you'd not know when it was done. Now, lie down and go
      to sleep. You are as sound as a silver dollar. It may sting just a little
      tiny bit when you swallow, but that will be gone by to-morrow. Go to
      sleep, and when you wake I'll have that tricycle ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God&mdash;thank God,&rdquo; Dora exclaimed, &ldquo;he is saved!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started up the stairs, and in desperation Galt caught her arm. &ldquo;Wait
      one moment, Dora,&rdquo; he implored, &ldquo;I have something to say. You must hear
      me. I am&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't stop me!&rdquo; She shook his hand loose from her sleeve, and the haughty
      look of contempt he had noticed before rose into her fathomless eyes as
      she glanced back at him. &ldquo;I am going up to him. I won't waken him. I'll be
      very quiet, but I must be near him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Standing at the foot of the stairs, he saw her ascend and disappear above.
      How beautiful she was! How rare and exquisite&mdash;how infinitely removed
      from her kind. And that was Dora&mdash;the Dora of all that was good and
      pure of his past, the guileless victim of all that was low, sordid, and
      unworthy within him!

      returned from the West one sultry evening at dusk, and went straight to
      the house of his employer. He found the banker seated on the front porch
      without his coat, and cooling himself with a big palm-leaf fan. &ldquo;So you
      are back?&rdquo; he said, casting a furtive glance over his shoulder into the
      unlighted hall. &ldquo;Get that chair and pull it up close. If my wife happens
      to come out while you are talking, sort o' switch off to something else&mdash;the
      market reports&mdash;anything under high heavens except what you went off
      for. She never took to Fred noway, and anything in his favor or otherwise
      sets her tongue going. She thinks he is plumb out of my present
      calculations, and any hint that he was getting on his feet would give her
      tantrums. She is back in the kitchen, seeing to the supper things. She is
      as close as the bark of a tree, and is afraid that nigger woman will lug
      off supplies. I took her because she was stingy. I sort o' admired it at
      first, but it ain't as becoming in a woman as it is in a man. I don't know
      why, but it ain't. Well, fire away. What did you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went straight out to Gate City, Mr. Walton,&rdquo; the clerk began, in the
      tone of a man full of an experience. &ldquo;I would have written home, but I
      didn't get on to much of importance the first three days, and then I knew
      I could get back about as quick as a letter could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; Walton said. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found it about the most hustling town I ever struck, Mr. Walton. It is
      wide open, I tell you. Of course, it isn't anything like as big, but it
      was as busylooking on the main streets as Atlanta or Nashville. I thought
      best not to be seen about the very <i>centre</i>, you know, so I took
      board in a little hotel in what they call 'Railroad Town,' on the east
      side, among the machine-shops. I pretended to be looking for a job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did, eh? You say you did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; and I found that it was a pretty good trick, for it set folks
      to chatting about the different enterprises in town. You may think it is
      funny,&rdquo; Toby laughed, impulsively&mdash;&ldquo;I know I did when I finally got
      the key to it&mdash;but I could hardly start any sort of talk with anybody
      who didn't sooner or later ring in the wonderful rise of a certain fellow
      by the name of 'Spencer,' who was in this same Whipple's employ. They all
      said he'd come there without a cent&mdash;a ragged tramp, in fact; but
      that he had taken hold in Whipple's big store, and forged ahead till he
      was the old man's mainstay and chief manager. They told about all sorts of
      deals that this 'Spencer' had helped Whipple put through. I got kind o'
      tired of it all, and would every now and then ask if there wasn't a young
      fellow by the name of 'Walton' working there; but they said if there was
      they had never heard of him, and went on about Spencer. I was beginning to
      think there might be something crooked in that fat man's tale to you, and
      at one time I laid awake all night troubled powerfully. You see, the
      fellow who called here and paid the three thousand might have been just
      using Whipple's name and reputation to help him work some scheme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you thought that!&rdquo; and Walton drew his brows together and bit his
      lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but not for long, Mr. Walton. The next day I ventured closer in to
      the centre of the town, and was looking about on the main street at the
      up-to-date improvements on all sides, when I saw a fellow thumping along
      the sidewalk that looked so much like our man that I dodged into the front
      part of a bar-room and waited till he went by. Then I pointed him out to a
      policeman, and asked him who it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why, that,' said the cop&mdash;'that is our big grocery king, Stephen
      Whipple. He is a self-made man, and as rich as goose-grease. He built us a
      fine church, a library out of white marble, and donated the land for a
      city park, and done a lot of other things.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he was all right, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, as I substantiated later,&rdquo; Toby ran on, enthusiastically. &ldquo;But
      the best thing is to be told, Mr. Walton. A few minutes after that who
      should I see but Fred himself rushing along the street with some
      account-books under his arm, as if he was in a great hurry. He was dressed
      as fine as a fiddle, and folks all along the street was bowing to him as
      if he owned the town. I dodged back into the bar and let him pass, and
      when I slipped out a minute later the same policeman nabbed me and pointed
      Fred out as he was walking on. 'That,' said the policeman, 'is Mr.
      Spencer, the old man's adopted son&mdash;the young man he has just taken
      into partnership. They are hanging a new sign down at the store now.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adopted son!&rdquo; fell from the-banker's lips. &ldquo;Spencer was Fred's middle
      name. Great Lord, Toby, do you reckon it's true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True as gospel, Mr. Walton. I heard a lot about it on all sides, but I
      saw enough with my own eyes to convince me that there was no mistake. I
      went out to where the Whipples live one dark, cloudy night, and walked
      clean round the house. I could see into the sitting-room, for it was
      lighted up bright. Whipple was there, and a gray-haired, kind-looking old
      lady that was his wife, I reckon, and Fred. They were all sitting round a
      green lamp on a table. From where I stood, of course, I couldn't hear a
      word that was said, but it seemed like Fred was telling some funny yarn or
      other, like he used to do here at home, you know, and both the old folks
      were laughing. I don't know when anything ever has affected me as much as
      that sight did. I reckon I was homesick myself, away out there playing the
      sneak, like I was, and it made me awful blue. You know, sir, I always <i>did</i>
      like Fred, and I don't believe many folks ever knew how much he missed his
      mother. And somehow, when I saw him in an entirely new home like that,
      away off from old ties, why&mdash;well&mdash;it sort o' got the best of
      me. Maybe, as I say, it was because I was homesick, but I never wanted to
      speak to anybody in all my life as much as I did to him at that minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The head of the banker went down, his chin rested on his breast, and he
      was silent for a few minutes. Then he looked up, threw a cautious,
      half-fearful glance back into the house, and rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's walk down to the gate,&rdquo; he said, in a low, unsteady voice. &ldquo;I want
      to talk, Toby, and yet I don't hardly know what a body could say. I have
      faced lots of criticism and slurs in my day and time, and never cared much
      what was said; but, between me and you, this thing strikes me down deep.
      You see, it is pretty tough the way it turned out&mdash;this having other
      folks give a body's son a home, and all that, and I hate to think that
      folks here in Stafford will get onto it and chatter. I understand 'em well
      enough to know, in advance, what they will say. I don't care what they
      think about me losing money, and the like, for that's just business. But
      the other thing cuts&mdash;it cuts deep. I reckon the boy didn't get any
      too much attention at home after I married the last time, and I reckon, if
      the truth was known, I was influenced against him some by his stepmother's
      constant nagging about his ways. I say I <i>reckon</i> I was influenced,
      for I hardly think I'd have been quite as tight on the boy if there had
      been just me and him left at home after his mother died. My first wife was
      a good woman, Toby. I never knew how good and loving she was till she was
      put away forever. But the town will talk now good fashion. They will say
      Fred served me' right to go off and get appreciated and loved by folks
      that was no blood kin, but who simply took him on merits I was too mean to
      see. They will have the laugh on me. They will call me an old hog, and I
      reckon I deserve it. You know, yourself, that I come within an inch of
      clapping handcuffs on him. I'd actually have done it if you hadn't shown
      me that it would go against my pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you look at it too seriously, Mr. Walton,&rdquo; Toby ventured to say,
      as the two leaned on the gate and looked down the gas-lighted street. &ldquo;You
      mustn't forget that Fred has been longing for your forgiveness all these
      years. What he did was wrong, it is true, and at present it may be the
      chief bar to his content. Besides, me and you are the only persons who
      know about his shortage. You have never been a man to talk of your private
      affairs, and, for all <i>this</i> town knows or ever <i>need</i> know, you
      may have been in touch with Fred all these years. In fact, they may not
      know but what the&mdash;the <i>other matter</i> was the only cause of
      Fred's leaving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toby, you are a good un! You'll do, you'll do! Of course, the woman
      business is bad, but the world somehow don't condemn it as heavy as some
      other things. No, you are right; this blasted town needn't know about the
      trouble between me and him. He won't want to come back here nohow till the
      other matter is arranged some way, and, between me and you, we can sort o'
      spring his big success on the town&mdash;kind o' off-hand, you know, as if
      it ain't nothing to wonder at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good idea, Mr. Walton!&rdquo; Toby declared, enthusiastically. &ldquo;It will set
      'em wild.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we'll leave the adopted-son part out, Toby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, sir; oh yes, sir; that needn't go in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might just tell about his being a partner in the business, or
      something along that line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'll go out there, Toby. It will be like pulling eye-teeth, but I'll
      go. I'll knuckle, too, I reckon, to that fat chump. I'll make my will in
      the boy's favor and show it to Whipple, with an itemized list of my
      holdings, here and there. He won't sneer then, I reckon. Besides, Fred
      won't go back on me. Blood's thicker than water, and if I have been harsh&mdash;well,
      even if I <i>have</i>, my money will be as acceptable as that old skunk's.
      Yes, I'll run out in a day or so. And, Toby, I'll not even touch on the
      woman-and-child affair. He may think it never got out; he may believe
      she's kept it quiet. In the letters he wrote me, he never once alluded to
      it, and that shows he is not ready to admit it, anyway. No, we won't push
      that on him at such a time; he never <i>would</i> want to come home if he
      knew there had been such an uproar.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>IMON WALTON had
      been away a week, and the force at the bank had not heard from him, when
      one morning Toby received a telegram from him dated that day in Atlanta.
      The carefully chosen ten words ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Meet me with horse and buggy at afternoon up train</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Toby went down to the old man's house, and, unassisted, got out the
      gaunt animal and the time-worn vehicle with the dilapidated leather hood,
      and drove to the station. He was in a fine glow of appreciation of the
      compliment implied by the telegram's being addressed solely to him, and by
      the additional fact that on returning from former journeys Walton had
      either walked home or taken the cars. Toby told himself, with no little
      unction, that it meant that his employer had something of a confidential
      nature to impart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train had scarcely come to a standstill when Simon, who was on the
      front platform of the first passenger-coach, sprang down, valise in hand,
      and, looking much the worse for the dust and fine cinders that lay on him
      like frost of the infernal regions, walked stiffly toward Toby and the
      buggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I see you got my wire,&rdquo; was his greeting, as he relinquished the
      valise and allowed Toby to put it behind the seat in the buggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I got it all right,&rdquo; the clerk responded. &ldquo;Shall we drive home or to
      the bank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walton waited till Toby was in the seat beside him; then he replied:
      &ldquo;Well, we may as well head for home, though I reckon we could take a sort
      o' roundabout direction through the edge of town. I want to tell you what
      I did out there, and we might not have as good a chance later. My wife
      will be nagging the life out of me for particulars, and while there are no
      particulars in this thing that she has any concern in, if I was to be
      cornered somewhere with you right at the start she'd think it strange.
      Then, on the other hand, if me and you slid off together the very minute I
      got to the bank, the rest might think I was partial, and so I thought this
      slow ride was the very idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course, Mr. Walton. I suppose you saw Fred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, but not the first shot out of the box.&rdquo; Walton took off his hat
      and wiped the perspiration from his brow, upon which lay the red imprint
      of his hatband, and smiled sheepishly. &ldquo;The truth is, Toby, the nigher I
      got to that blamed town the sillier I felt, till by the time I was there
      and duly quartered at what they told me was their best hotel I hardly knew
      my hat from a hole in the ground. You see, my predicament was peculiar,
      and would have been odd to <i>any</i> man in the plight I was in. I didn't
      know but two souls in the town. One of 'em was not only the great high
      mucky-muck of the place, but a man I'd called a thief and a liar and
      kicked plumb out of my sanctum when he had called to do me a <i>favor</i>;
      and the other was&mdash;well, he was my only son, who I had treated like a
      yellow dog. You see, I knew that downright apologies was what I owed <i>both</i>
      of 'em; but, Toby, let me tell you something odd&mdash;I don't know how to
      account for it: but, as just and upright as I've always been in my
      dealings in a <i>general</i> way, I never, in so many plain words, ever
      told a human being I was sorry. I have been that way, and was willing to
      try to sort o' <i>look</i> it, in cases where I was <i>dead</i> wrong; but
      I'd rather take a thousand lashes on my bare back any day than come right
      out and beg a fellow's pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Toby said, sympathetically. &ldquo;A great many folks are that
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't think I'm like a great many folks,&rdquo; Walton replied, as his
      eyes rested on the back of his horse, &ldquo;but I couldn't swallow that pill.
      So there I was, registered at that fine joint, with a front room all to
      myself, overlooking the street, and the clerks and nigger porters looking
      at me, same as to say, 'Well, what is your game? Are you a whiskey
      drummer, bank-examiner, detective, stock-drover, or escaped convict?' I
      was like a fish out of water. I didn't know what to do or how to make any
      sort of start. I sat round the office half the time, and the rest I was
      flopping about in my room. The first day passed that way, and the next
      night, in which I had hardly got a wink of sleep. There was a bar-room and
      gambling-hell right under me, and I could hear some whizzing thing and
      balls rolling, and a deep voice calling out in some game or other. It was
      a gay town, and I was in the middle of it. The next morning I determined
      I'd write Fred a note and let him know where I was at, but I'd no sooner
      got it ready and backed and sealed than I recalled that Fred wasn't using
      his own name, and that a note addressed to him in the old style might
      cause talk, and so I tore it up. Then I ventured out and, half-scared to
      death, actually walked by the big store&mdash;on the opposite side of the
      street, though&mdash;and peeped in through the windows. It was as busy as
      a beehive during a swarm, but I couldn't see head nor tail of Fred. All at
      once I took the bit in my mouth and started across the street to go in,
      but was stopped short. And what do you reckon done it, Toby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't imagine, Mr. Walton,&rdquo; said the clerk, deeply interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toby, it was that new sign you spoke about&mdash;'Stephen Whipple &amp;
      Son.' It was on the front of the big red building, and seemed to me to be
      just so many long, black letters stalking clean across the sky. 'Stephen
      Whipple &amp; Son,' and the last word, small as it was, overtopped all the
      rest. The thing simply knocked me silly. Wasn't it Saint Paul (it was <i>one</i>
      of them fellows in the good Book) that fell down in some great light that
      blazed out over him? Mine wasn't a light; it wasn't wind; it wasn't a kick
      in the jaw from an army mule, but it hit me like all three combined. I was
      mad; I was sorry; I was ashamed; but I couldn't walk under that
      dad-blasted sign. It hung over them doors like a long white sword of an
      enemy ready to chop me into halves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I whirled about and went back to my room and actually hid the rest of the
      day, wondering how on earth I was going to do the job. Once I packed up my
      valise and started down to pay my bill, with the intention of shirking the
      whole thing; but I saw that wouldn't do. So I passed another day. I read
      my Bible a little, and I reckon I prayed some. I don't know, Toby, but I
      would have bowed down before a heathen idol to have got help out of my
      predicament. I remembered what you said about seeing Fred at Whipple's
      house, and the next night I went out and inquired the way to his place. I
      found it, and, having nothing better to do, I walked clean around it like
      you did. Nobody was in sight, but I could see lights inside, and then the
      thought came to me that Fred, my son, maybe, was at that very minute in
      there keeping company with that old man and woman, and that made me feel
      as bad as the sign had. I tried to argue that I'd been right in pinning
      down on the boy for what he had done; but I knew there was no stability to
      my point, for that fat chap had secured better results through a different
      method, and <i>he</i> wasn't no blood <i>kin</i>. So I went back to the
      hotel, and made another night of it. I wasn't like you. I couldn't talk to
      strangers in an off-hand way about it. I tried once to the clerk behind
      the counter, but I couldn't make it go. He looked at me mighty curious,
      and I changed the subject. I think I asked him if that State wa'n't heavy
      on hog-raising.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were in an embarrassing position,&rdquo; Toby remarked, as he shook the
      drooping lines over the plodding horse's back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never would have got out of it if it hadn't been by pure accident,&rdquo;
       Walton said. &ldquo;The office of the hotel was a sort of meeting-place for the
      young men of the town of an evening, and there was a little smoking and
      writing room off of it. I was sitting there on the third evening, and the
      office was thronged with young chaps. Some sort of entertainment was on
      hand at the opera-house across the street, for a band was playing outside,
      and the young men in their best outfits were smoking and chatting in the
      office, when who should I see come in but Fred. He came in at the front
      door in a swallowtail suit with a light overcoat on his arm, and I tell
      you the crowd all made way for him. Toby, I am an old man; I've been
      through the rubs; I've seen near and dear comrades shot down at my side on
      the field of battle; I have had all sorts of experiences; but the sight of
      my boy there looking so much older and more dignified than when I last saw
      him&mdash;a sort of king among his kind&mdash;with this one and that one
      giving him the glad hand, and hailing him right and left with words and
      smiles of welcome while I was slinking off there&mdash;well, Toby, I don't
      want to live that over again; I don't; as God is my Creator, I don't! I
      sat there watching him through the door like&mdash;well, you'll have to
      imagine it, and draw your own conclusions; I can't tell you how I felt. I
      was dumb; I was speechless. It was like a double nightmare. I haven't shed
      enough tears in my life to drown a gnat, but I wanted to cry good and
      hearty then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you met him&mdash;I know you did,&rdquo; Toby broke in. &ldquo;I see it in your
      face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, as luck would have it, by accident; he left the others and come
      right into the room, and I saw that he'd recognized me, for he turned pale
      as death, and stopped in front of me. Then I saw him steady himself, and a
      pitiful, resigned look come over him. If I live through eternity, I'll
      never forget his first words. What do you think he said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't imagine, Mr. Walton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toby, he said this&mdash;he said this, and the words will haunt me to my
      grave. They will go with me into the very depths of my last abode. He
      said: 'Oh, father, you have caught me! You have come to take me back!
      Well, I am ready!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toby Lassiter, talk about your&mdash;your hells on earth; talk about your
      flames of despair, the worm that dieth not, and the like. I had 'em all. I
      couldn't speak. I didn't even have the sense or power to shake hands, and
      the poor boy misunderstood even that. He pulled up a chair, shaking like a
      leaf. Nobody was in the room but us two. Then somehow I managed to say
      that he was mistaken, and that I hadn't come there for <i>that</i> reason.
      I wanted to talk to the point and justify myself, but I was worse than a
      stuttering idiot at a spelling-bee. Like a fool, I started in to say that
      I had heard a lot about the progress of the town, and he thought I had
      some speculation on foot and had run on him by accident. I no sooner saw
      that he thought that than I got tangled up worse than ever. Nothing short
      of begging his forgiveness would set things straight, and I couldn't have
      got that out to have saved my soul from perdition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That certainly <i>was</i> awkward,&rdquo; Toby burst out, like an enthusiast at
      a play. &ldquo;It was bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon we never would have understood each other, Toby, but we started
      to walk out together, and went along to a side street that run into a park
      where it wasn't so light. Somehow we went inside, and before I knew it I
      had laid my hand on his arm. I never had done a thing like that in all my
      life, and all of a sudden we stopped and he looked right in my face. It
      was too much for me, Toby. I couldn't hold in any longer. But it didn't do
      any harm, for I saw he understood me, and that was enough. He was the
      happiest creature I ever laid eyes on; he laughed and cried and petted me,
      and said that he loved me a hundred times more than he did old Whipple and
      his wife. Then we sat down on a bench under the trees and talked it all
      over. He talked to me more openly than he ever did before. He wanted to
      come home above all things, but he wanted to put it off awhile. He told me
      about him and Margaret Dearing. She was the only real sweetheart he'd ever
      had, he said, and he could never care for anybody else. It seems that they
      met by accident awhile back in New York, and she gave him to understand
      that she didn't care any more for him. He said it was because she knew of
      his shortage at the bank. But I told him how you and me had kept that
      quiet, and not to let that bother him. But he told me something that we
      didn't know: he said he had confessed it to her brother the night he left.
      He said a woman as high and proud as she was never could overlook anything
      bordering on dishonesty, no matter how much it was atoned for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wouldn't be so hard on him if <i>that</i> was all, Mr. Walton,&rdquo; Toby
      said. &ldquo;But, of course, she heard about the other thing; in fact, the girl
      and the child are right there under her eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That occurred to me while me and him was talking,&rdquo; Walton said; &ldquo;but I
      simply couldn't bring up a nasty thing like that at such a time. I thought
      that might as well rest; in fact, it looked to me like he thought his name
      had never been mixed up with it. You see, Toby, maybe the woman promised
      that it shouldn't get out, and has kept him from knowing of the report in
      order to bleed his pocket. At any rate, he don't seem to suspect what
      folks are saying here at home. I know he wants to keep <i>me</i> in the
      dark, for he boldly asked me about Dora Barry, among other inquiries. I
      was astonished at it, but he wanted to know if she'd ever got married, and
      when I told him no, he went on to say that she was the best friend he'd
      ever had among the home girls, and that she had a beautiful character, and
      the like. He went on to say that she was the finest painter of pictures he
      had ever seen, and that when he left he was sure she would make a great
      artist out of her turn that way. He asked me if she had put her talent to
      any use, and I told him if she had I hadn't heard about it. Then he said&mdash;he
      did&mdash;that he was going to sit down and write her a friendly letter,
      and tell her where he was at, now that me and him had made up. I thought
      he was piling it on pretty heavy, you know, but I never let on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was best, of course,&rdquo; Toby opined, reflectively. &ldquo;Folks are not apt
      to throw up a thing like that to a man who has turned over a new leaf, and
      it may be many a year before he discovers how much has really been talked
      on that line. But you didn't tell me, Mr. Walton. Did you see Fred's&mdash;did
      you see Mr. Whipple?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It went powerfully against the grain, but I had to,&rdquo; the banker said,
      gruffly. &ldquo;I was in for making a beeline back home without having to
      swallow that dose, but Fred wouldn't hear to it. He said the old skunk
      would feel hurt. I didn't care a dad-dratted cent whether he felt hurt or
      not; in fact, I felt hurt to have him dragged in at all. I'm glad the boy
      has landed in such a pile of clover, but I don't like Whipple any too
      much, and I reckon that dang sign of his was my Belshazzar's warning on
      the wall. But it is this way&mdash;well, you know what I mean. I reckon a
      body can look at it from any direction&mdash;level, sink, or angle&mdash;and
      the fact will still stick out that the boy is divided, and will have to
      remain divided from now on. That ain't usual, Toby; it is crooked. It sort
      o' gives the lie to my success as a father. I won't go into it any
      further. The whole thing out there, though, would have gone off smooth
      enough if that old cuss hadn't been in it. He had a slobbery way of
      talking to Fred, and put his hands on him every chance he got. They asked
      me out to dinner at Whipple's house to meet the old woman, but I drew the
      line at that. I was sure she'd act the fool as bad, or worse, than Whipple
      had, and so I wouldn't go. I never was mushy in that way myself, and I
      can't stomach them that are. Whipple is going to leave him all he's got,
      and I want Fred to get all he can of the good things in life, but I'll be
      dad-blamed if I wanted 'em to come exactly that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whipple set there in his office and made out a list of his possessions,
      and it looked to me like he was making everything look as big as he could
      out of pure spite. Not once did he say&mdash;Toby, he didn't say a single
      time that I had <i>any</i> sort of justification in pinning down on the
      boy like I did. He might have done it, but he didn't. He always cocked
      himself up and talked in a roundabout, sneaking fashion, like he was
      giving underhanded digs. Toby, I want the boy back here, that's all. I
      want him back here in the bank to take my place after I'm gone. I don't
      think I could stand it to be beat to a cold, dead finish by that old chump
      in a fight of exactly this kind. Whipple said Fred could sort o' play
      between the two places&mdash;stay awhile here and awhile there, but I want
      to tie him down good and tight to old Stafford. I've got an idea how to do
      it, Toby, and it ain't a bad one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Mr. Walton?&rdquo; the clerk asked, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Toby, I ain't much at match-making, but I am going to try my hand at
      the game. Now, if I could only persuade Margaret Dearing to be sensible,
      like most women always have been in regard to the early slips of the men
      they marry&mdash;if I could persuade her to overlook the only thing that
      now remains against the boy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would get married, and both would prefer to live here!&rdquo; Toby broke
      in, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the point, Toby,&rdquo; Walton said. &ldquo;You've hit it. Now drive me home.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>NE afternoon,
      three days after this, Simon Walton drove down the street to Dearing's,
      and, alighting at the front gate, he carefully haltered his horse to the
      hitching-post with a rope he always carried under the buggy-seat. Then he
      opened the gate and trudged up the walk to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret saw him from the window of her room upstairs, and, thinking that
      he had called to see her uncle or her brother, she hurried down-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you want to see my uncle?&rdquo; she asked, sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn't, Miss Margaret.&rdquo; Walton had taken off his broad-brimmed felt
      hat, and stood shifting it awkwardly from one hand to the other, a look at
      once grave and agitated on his gaunt face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my <i>brother</i> is at his office,&rdquo; the girl threw tentatively
      into the pause that had ensued; &ldquo;at least, he said he was going there when
      he left here about two o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't want to see him, <i>either</i>,&rdquo; and the old man tried to smile,
      but the effort was a grim failure. &ldquo;The truth is, Miss Margaret, if I may
      make so bold, I wanted to see <i>you</i>. There is a little matter I sort
      o' thought you and me might talk over maybe to mutual gain and profit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to see me, really?&rdquo; Margaret started. &ldquo;Well, won't you come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walton glanced into the wide hall doubtfully and fanned himself with his
      hat. &ldquo;I don't know; it must be kind o' stuffy inside on a sweltering day
      like this, ain't it?&rdquo; he said, awkwardly. &ldquo;Ain't there a place out under
      the trees somewhere where we could set a minute? I was here one day with
      the General, and round that way&mdash;&rdquo; Walton nodded his shaggy head to
      the right and broke off helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, and there are some chairs there, too,&rdquo; Margaret answered. She was
      now quite grave, and she led the way with a certain erectness of carriage
      and with an air of restraint that was visible even to the crude
      sensibilities of her caller.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chairs under the trees were reached. Walton seized the most
      comfortable-looking one, and for no obvious reason settled it firmly on
      the sod. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, and with bended body he waited for her to take
      it. When she had complied, he took a seat himself, dropping his hat on the
      grass beside him, only to recover it without delay, that it might rest on
      his sharp, unsteady knee. He looked up at the unclouded sky, at the
      overhanging boughs of the big oaks under which they sat. He cleared his
      throat, looked at Margaret, and then glanced over his shoulder at the roof
      and gables of the old house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said, I think, that you came to see me,&rdquo; Margaret reminded him, with
      as much voice as she could command, for all sorts of bewildering
      possibilities were flitting through her brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did, Miss Margaret,&rdquo; he said, with a slight start. &ldquo;If you was a
      man, now, I think we could get this thing over with in a short time; but I
      never had much dealings with women&mdash;that is, except in a purely
      business way. I can tell a woman she is over-checking, or offering me bad
      security, or needs better identification than a pair of bright eyes and
      rosy cheeks will furnish; but this thing that's riz between me and you is
      plumb different. In the bank they come to <i>me</i>, but in this case, you
      see, <i>I'm</i> the supplicant. Miss Margaret, I've come to see you about
      my boy&mdash;about Fred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you want to find him, and you think that perhaps I&mdash;&rdquo; She went
      no further. Her first impulsive thought was that Walton had in some way
      heard of her meeting with Fred in New York and had come to obtain
      information as to his address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no; I know where he is well enough.&rdquo; The way seemed easier to the old
      man now, and he went on rapidly. &ldquo;He is at Gate City, Oklahoma, Miss
      Margaret. He has been there all this time, and is doing mighty well; in
      fact, he has gone and got rich. You know the West is a powerful field for
      fresh, young blood to forge ahead in, and Fred struck it just right. He is
      a partner in a whopping big wholesale business there. He has been writing
      to me&mdash;that is, off and on. There <i>was</i> a little cash difference
      between his account and mine, and he finally made it good out of his
      earnings. I&mdash;I never was much of a hand to talk my business, you
      know, so I've never let on here at Stafford exactly how he <i>was</i>
      making out, but a time has come when I want to set him as nigh straight as
      possible before the community he was born and raised in; in fact, I want
      him to come home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo; Margaret's cold, pale lips formally dropped the words as
      her visitor paused and wiped his perspiring brow and fanned himself with
      his hat..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've just been out there to sort o' settle up a little deal betwixt
      me and the man&mdash;twixt me and Fred's business partner, and I must say
      the whole outlook was good. You know I reckon that everybody in this town
      sort o' thought before Fred went off that he never would amount to much in
      a business way, but he is all right now. So, having nothing much to do at
      the bank this hot day, why, I thought I'd drive up here and see you about
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See <i>me</i> about it? I really don't understand,&rdquo; the young lady
      faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to come right to the point, Miss Margaret&rdquo;&mdash;Walton avoided her
      wavering glance for a moment as he kicked the toe of his boot into an
      unoffending tuft of grass and fairly uprooted it&mdash;&ldquo;out there in Gate
      City one night me and Fred had a sort o' confidential talk about old
      times, and one thing or other, and finally he broke down and told me how
      much attached he had always been to you&mdash;never had cared for no other
      woman, nor never would as long as the sun shone on the earth, and other
      things to that effect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Walton, please don't!&rdquo; Margaret cried out; but there was a glow
      of irrepressible delight rising in her face, and her beautiful eyes were
      sparkling. &ldquo;I don't think I want to talk about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>have</i> to,&rdquo; the banker insisted, firmly. &ldquo;I want him back here,
      Miss Margaret; and, as it stands now, I'm afraid he never will come unless
      you yield a point or two. He said his one and only spur to making a man of
      himself had been the hope that&mdash;seeing that you hadn't yet chosen a
      partner&mdash;that you might some day or other consider his proposal. He
      says, though, that he met you in New York, awhile back, and that you
      deliberately turned him down. He said he couldn't blame you, after all
      that had happened, but he couldn't help thinking that maybe it would be as
      well for him never to come nigh you again. That was the way, I say, that
      <i>he</i> looked at it, blue and down-in-the-mouth, as the poor fellow was
      during our confab; but I threw out a straw to him, so I did, Miss
      Margaret. I cited numbers and numbers of cases where young men had
      eventually lived down early mistakes, and finally been reinstated, to
      become, in the end, an honor to the land of their birth. He didn't think,
      after the way you acted in New York, that there was any chance for him at
      all, but, being anxious to make headway, I told him I was sure you was too
      much of a Christian at heart to refuse a request like his, offered in the
      spirit it is offered in. He's sorry for many things that's he done, and
      wants to wipe 'em out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Walton's eyes shifted almost significantly from her face to the low
      roof of Mrs. Barry's cottage, and instinctively Margaret's glance
      followed; then, becoming conscious of the fact, she quickly looked down,
      and a tinge of color climbed into her pale cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we'd better not say any more about that, Mr. Walton,&rdquo; she said,
      more firmly than she had spoken since his arrival. &ldquo;I am sure your son
      understands how I feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means a flat no, then,&rdquo; the banker said, and with a heavy sigh he
      slowly stood up. &ldquo;Well, I've plead <i>his</i> case as well as I know how,
      but I hain't yet touched on <i>mine</i>. Miss Margaret, you could do me a
      big, lasting favor if you'd let this thing go through. I'm a plain man.
      Folks hain't never said I was much of a hand to show affection, and they
      are right, I reckon; but the way matters stand now is getting me down, and
      if you don't extend a helping hand I'm afraid I'll feel bad the rest of my
      life. It ain't just <i>Fred</i> that's concerned&mdash;it's me&mdash;<i>me!</i>
      As long as a father can make himself believe he is treating his son
      justly, he can hold his head up and meet the eye of the world; but, if the
      truth must be told, I reckon I didn't give Fred a good enough show. I
      driv' him off, with threats of the law, and away off in a strange land,
      under a new name, he forged ahead. He made friends by the stack, and the
      old man&mdash;his partner that I told you about&mdash;loves him like he
      was his own; in fact, he calls him his '<i>adopted son</i>.' Think of
      that! The only child the Lord ever give me is now claimed by a blamed old
      cuss that understood him better than I ever did! He has willed him all
      he's got, and he's got plenty, too&mdash;a sight more than I'll ever have
      if I keep on till the end of the chapter. I want to hold my own, Miss
      Margaret. I hain't never been clean beat yet, and this, somehow, would be
      the worst fall I ever had. I just can't stomach the idea! I want my boy to
      love <i>me</i>, and lean on <i>me,</i> and not on a fat, pudgy old idiot
      that never had a thing to do with his baby days. I want that worse than I
      ever wanted anything, and I don't see how I'm going to get it if you don't
      help a little. If your pride won't let you do it for <i>him</i>, maybe it
      will for an old chap like me, that is begging for one more throw of the
      dice. I simply want him back, and he won't come unless you will let
      bygones be bygones.&rdquo; He paused. Something very much like strong emotion
      was in his whole dejected attitude as he stood bowed before her. She
      started to speak, but stopped, clasping her delicate hands undecidedly in
      front of her. She stood silent for a moment, and then she said, softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see; it is hard on you. It is a pity you have to suffer on account of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promise me this, Miss Margaret.&rdquo; Old Walton leaned forward eagerly.
      &ldquo;Promise that you will think it over for a day or so. It ain't a thing,
      anyway, to be decided in a second, like buying a hat or a pair of gloves
      of such and such a color or material. If you have to go plumb against the
      boy, do it after mature deliberation. Won't you study over it a day or
      two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I can promise that,&rdquo; Margaret consented. &ldquo;I'll stop in at the bank
      and see you soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's all a body <i>could</i> ask,&rdquo; Walton said, gratefully; and,
      bowing low, he trudged across the grass to his horse and buggy.

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN he had
      disappeared down the street, Margaret sat staring at the ground, her color
      still high, her eyes holding a delicate, spiritual effulgence, her breast
      rising and falling under stress of fiercely contending impulses, my
      Christian duty to forgive,&rdquo; she argued. &ldquo;I know he has repented, and he
      couldn't have been wholly to blame. His grosser nature was tempted. He
      fell, but he loved <i>me</i> in a different way. He loves me still, or he
      wouldn't want me now. He showed it in New York. He has suffered enough,
      and I ought to take him back. But can I? <i>Can</i> I? How could I forget,
      with her and his child right under my eyes? Perhaps, if I went to see her,
      that might help me decide. I ought to have gone, anyway. She really has
      had a hard life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With her hand on her breast, as though the thought had given her actual
      physical pain, she bowed for a few minutes; then she calmly rose, fastened
      the strings of her graceful hat under her pretty chin, and walked
      deliberately down to Mrs. Barry's. Lionel was playing with some colored
      building-blocks on the porch, and looked up in vast surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your mother?&rdquo; Margaret asked, timidly. &ldquo;May I see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is in the studio,&rdquo; the child said. &ldquo;She is making a picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Dora stepped out into the hall from a room on the right,
      and with a look of undisguised and almost perturbed surprise she came
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she <i>is</i> beautiful&mdash;beautiful!&rdquo; ran like a dart through the
      visitor's brain. &ldquo;She is a thousand times more now than she used to be;
      she has grown, developed. Such hair, such eyes, such color, such a perfect
      figure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I heard you asking for me,&rdquo; Dora said, calmly, something&mdash;perhaps
      it was the sheer immunity of genius and conscious purity of purpose&mdash;lifting
      her above the embarrassment of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I came to see you,&rdquo; Margaret said, bewildered by Dora's appearance
      and the growing sense of her wonderful and forceful personality. &ldquo;I ought
      to have come before, I am well aware; but I hope you won't turn me away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I, Margaret?&rdquo; Even in the unruffled voice of the recluse there
      was a mellow hint of oblivion to the social degradation the outside world
      had draped her with. &ldquo;Would you mind coming into my workroom? It is about
      as cheerful as our stuffy little parlor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you still paint?&rdquo; Margaret cried, as she stood in the doorway and saw
      the pictures leaning here and there and tacked to the wooden partition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I had to have some occupation,&rdquo; Dora responded, quite frankly, &ldquo;and
      I took it up. I think I should have died but for my art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you really do all these?&rdquo; Margaret stared in admiration. &ldquo;Oh,
      they are lovely, lovely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you like them,&rdquo; Dora said, appreciatively. &ldquo;I am sorry I happen
      to have only these. Just last week I sent a box of the best away. I may as
      well tell you that I sell them&mdash;or, rather, have them sold for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you do, really? How nice!&mdash;how very nice!&rdquo; Margaret sat down
      almost in utter bewilderment. The whole thing was like a dream&mdash;the
      wonderful intellectual poise of the girl-like artist; her beauty; her
      charm; the far-away look of almost conscious superiority in the
      long-lashed, indescribable eyes. &ldquo;And you intend to go on with your art?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, to the end&mdash;to the very end of life, and beyond, too,
      perhaps,&rdquo; answered Dora, with a merry, philosophical laugh. &ldquo;I am working
      toward a glorious goal. Far-off Paris beckons me, Margaret, even in my
      sleep. Mother and I read of nothing else now, and think of nothing else.
      We study French in our poor way, and speak it together. Even Lionel lisps
      a word of it now and then. Yes, Paris and my boy mean all to me now. This
      has been a prison for our little family, but there the breath of art
      animates all life. The people are not narrow; they rank essential purity
      above the sordid hypocrisy of mere convention. There my boy might grow up
      unconscious of&mdash;but you know what I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Margaret said, a vast womanly sympathy springing up within her
      that fairly swept her from the condemnatory position she had so long held.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we hope to manage it very soon now,&rdquo; the artist continued. &ldquo;We are
      hoarding up my earnings for that, and nothing else. Lionel has the soul of
      a poet, artist, or musician, and in Paris he can grow and expand, and
      there&mdash;there he will not have to face what would inevitably be his
      portion if he remained here. His misfortune, if it can be called that, was
      not of his making, and God will help me to wipe it out of his
      consciousness&mdash;to blot it from his fair young soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Margaret said, helplessly, and she rose to go. There was
      nothing she could say. Dora, in some unaccountable way, seemed beyond her
      mental reach, a glorious, sublimated creature more of spirit than of
      matter. The things she had striven for in her solitude had raised her
      higher than her surroundings. From a narrow point of view she had lost,
      from a higher and broader she had gained; she was the youthful forerunner
      of a future army of women who would be judged by the radiance of their
      souls rather than by the shadows of their bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora seemed to feel her sudden nearness in spirit to her old friend. For a
      moment she was silent. There was a clatter of blocks on the floor of the
      porch, followed by the soft click-click of the pieces of wood as the child
      put them together again from the heap into which they had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always wanted to have a good, long talk with you about Fred,&rdquo; Dora
      suddenly began, &ldquo;but I hardly knew how to propose it to you after&mdash;at
      least, after he went away so suddenly. I felt that I ought to see you
      personally, and yet my pride would not let me. He had his faults,
      Margaret, but there were many beautiful things in his character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know.&rdquo; Margaret's heart fairly froze, and she stared coldly and
      held herself quite erect. Was it possible that the woman would dare to
      intimate that she cared to hear about that shameful intimacy? Had her
      ideas of art, her dreams of France and bohemian freedom from conventional
      laws, led her into the error of thinking that she, Margaret Dearing, would
      for a moment listen to such a confidence?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only to-day I received a long letter from him,&rdquo; Dora went on, unobservant
      of the change that had come over her visitor. &ldquo;Let me get it. I am sure
      you will think more kindly of him when you have read what he writes. His
      father has been out to see him, and they are quite reconciled now. It has
      made Fred very happy. You see, there is no reason now why he may not come
      home. I want you to see the letter, for he mentions you in it, and I am
      sure, seeing how sweet and kind you are to me, that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care to see it!&rdquo; Margaret broke in, frigidly. &ldquo;Please don't ask
      me. I am just going. I only had a few moments. I thank you very much for
      showing me your pictures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dora dropped her eyes in surprise, for the gaze of her haughty visitor was
      full of undisguised anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean to offend you,&rdquo; she said, humbly, &ldquo;and I hope you will
      pardon me. I was only trying to do Fred a good turn, and I suppose I did
      it awkwardly. It is very good of you to come. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo; And Margaret swept from the room. As she crossed the porch and
      passed the little architect of a church of no mean design, he raised his
      eyes and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, lady; that is the tower for the big bell (ding-dong!), and this is
      the door&mdash;&rdquo; But she paid no heed to him, as, with a shrug, almost of
      disdain, she passed on to the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is writing to her; he has been writing to her all these years,&rdquo; she
      said within herself. &ldquo;Perhaps he has even met her&mdash;she may have been
      to see him in other places. That is why she's lived so quietly&mdash;it
      gave her the chance to go and come as she liked. Perhaps he has put those
      ideas of Paris and free-love into her head. When he talked to me in New
      York he didn't mean that&mdash;that he cared for me deeply. He meant only
      that he wanted me and the rest of us here to overlook what he had done.
      When he told his silly old father that he would not come back unless I
      forgave him, he meant&mdash;he thought&mdash;he was trying to apologize&mdash;actually
      <i>apologize</i>&mdash;for having made love to me. I have lowered myself
      by going to her. It gave her that sly chance to stab me. She thinks I
      care. She thinks that I have been crying my eyes out about him. They have
      talked me over time after time. Oh, the shame of it&mdash;the utter <i>shame</i>
      of it!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ARGARET DEARING
      passed a restless, tumultuous night following the disturbing visit to
      Dora. In the evening she had joined her uncle at a game of whist in a
      nervous, abstracted way; she had played the piano in a spiritless fashion
      for her brother, who had come in tired from a long drive into the country,
      where he had performed a successful surgical operation; and then she had
      gone up to her bedchamber and thrown off the mask. She kept it off, for
      there was only the starlight to witness her white, blank face and
      piteously staring eyes as she sat at her window looking out. From the
      stretch of darkness below only one salient feature presented itself: it
      was the steadily burning light in Dora Barry's window. In her fancy
      Margaret saw the beautiful young mother bending over a table writing&mdash;writing
      to Fred Walton in answer to the last letter he had written. She rose
      suddenly, exasperated beyond endurance, and threw herself on her bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose late the next morning and breakfasted in the big, sombre
      dining-room after the General and Wynn had gone to town. The servant said
      something she hardly heard, to the effect that Wynn had received a letter
      which called him to Augusta, and that he might be absent for several days.
      Breakfast over, Margaret strolled down to a favorite seat of hers on the
      lawn. Why was it, she asked herself, with poignant chagrin, that she
      welcomed the position as putting her into the full view of any one
      chancing to look from Dora Barry's cottage? Had she been very subtle in
      self-analysis and very frank touching her own desires, she would have
      admitted the subtle suggestion of her attitude, her apparent absorption in
      the magazine that she held in hand; must it not convey to her watching
      neighbor a conviction that the conversation of the afternoon just passed
      had been of no possible moment to her&mdash;that it had, in fact, caused
      no ripple in the even current of her satisfied existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, the pages of the magazine were held so firmly before her
      unshifting eyes that she failed to notice that Lionel had crossed over the
      fence and was coming toward her holding an envelope in his little hand. He
      was dressed in a becoming gray suit, and his yellow, carefully brushed
      tresses caught the morning sunlight till they seemed a mass of delicate
      golden flames. The grass he daintily trod was wet with dew, and opalescent
      jewels seemed to blaze and fall at his feet. Margaret saw him from the
      corner of her eye as he timidly paused near her, and yet she did not at
      first deign to look up. The grim thought fastened itself on her distorted
      imagination that Dora was now watching, if at no other moment, so she
      lowered the magazine to her lap, taking studied care to turn down a leaf
      before glancing at the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother sent this note,&rdquo; Lionel said, when he caught her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the envelope and opened it. It contained two separate
      communications. The first was to her from Dora. The other was in Fred
      Walton's well-remembered hand. Dora's note ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dear Margaret,&mdash;I want you to do poor Fred the simple justice of
      reading his letter to me. I saw yesterday that you were angered by my
      mentioning him, and I don't believe you could have been so if you had the
      faith in him which he deserves. You may doubt him, for some reason or
      other, but I am sure you could do so no longer if you would only read the
      tender things he has written about you. Sincerely, Dora Barry.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret read and reread the note. Her prejudice was still playing riot
      with her better judgment, and, feeling sure that Dora's eyes were on her,
      she scornfully swept both the communications from her lap to the grass at
      her feet and turned to her magazine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lionel stared, a pained expression slowly capturing his mobile features as
      he stood in rigid indecision for a moment; then, with a sigh, he stooped
      down and picked up the sheets of paper which were being blown about on the
      grass. The first page of Fred Walton's letter to Dora was the last he
      secured, and, just as he was picking it up, Margaret, almost against her
      will, dropped her glance upon it, reading the introductory line at the top
      of the sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear old friend,&rdquo; she saw quite plainly, in Fred's bold writing, &ldquo;You
      will be surprised to hear from me for the first time after all these years&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Old friend&mdash;after all these years!</i>&rdquo; Those words, so
      contradictory to what she expected, remained before Margaret's sight even
      after the child had gathered the sheets in his offended arms and was
      turning away. What could they mean? Surely that was not the way a man
      would begin a letter to the woman he had betrayed and deserted. There must
      be some mystery, and the child was bearing its solution away. Her desire
      to know more was too strong to be resisted. Impulsively she cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little boy! Lionel! Wait! Bring them back! I dropped them!&rdquo; He turned, a
      look of mystification on his face, and came back doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't read them yet,&rdquo; she explained, humbly enough, and she extended
      her hand. &ldquo;Let me have them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were angry,&rdquo; he said, staring at her. &ldquo;I thought you didn't
      want my mother's letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll read them,&rdquo; she promised, tremblingly. &ldquo;Wait, won't you? That's a
      good boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood beside her, studiously observant of the phenomenon of her
      changeableness, while she literally devoured Fred Walton's letter. It ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear old friend,&mdash;You will be surprised to hear from me for the
      first time after all these years, and I have no valid excuse to offer. You
      may or may not have received the letter I wrote you telling you that I was
      leaving old Stafford forever. My bad conduct had driven my father to
      desperation, and I had grave reasons to believe that he would actually
      enforce the law against me. I had made up my mind to turn over a new leaf
      and fight it out on new lines at home, when the last straw came to break
      my purpose. Dear Dora, her brother Wynn approached me that very night and
      told me that her uncle intended positively to disinherit her if she kept
      faith in me. What was there for me to do? God knows I was unworthy of her,
      and the next morning was to bring things to light which would make her
      despise me; so I promised him then and there to go away and never
      communicate with her again. No human being ever suffered more keenly than
      I did at losing her, but I determined to fight my way to reformation, and
      by my own toil to restore to my father the funds I had misappropriated.
      After years of strife and hardship I have done it, and he has fully
      forgiven me. He has forgiven me and wants me to come home. <i>Home!</i>
      Just think of it! To me old Stafford would be a heaven on earth. I think I
      could fall face downward in the dear old streets and kiss the very
      pavement. But I may not come yet. Somehow I can't, Dora. I believe most of
      the old town will forgive me, but she won't. I know she won't. Her ideas
      of honor are too high for that. The reason I am so sure is that I met her
      by chance in New York not long ago, and she gave me clearly to understand
      that I need never expect to regain her respect. I made my own case out
      pretty black to her brother, and I suppose he gave me my full dues in
      telling her about it. To my astonishment, my father told me that he had
      not spoken of my shortage at the bank, and that nothing had been said
      about it at home, but her brother told her. She got the confession
      straight from me, and there could be no better authority. I love her
      still, dear Dora, and more than ever. The very gulf between her and me has
      only made her the dearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I mustn't write so much about myself. My father says you are still
      unmarried. He couldn't tell me whether you had carried your painting
      further. I was sure it would do great things for you, and it is not too
      late, even yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing&mdash;I have always felt that I may have hurt your feelings
      past forgiveness by advising you as I did in that last letter not to trust
      too fully the man whom I mentioned. I now see that I had no right to go so
      far. You were hardly more than a child then, but you knew how to take care
      of yourself even with a man of the world like him, and I had no right to
      warn you. But I was going away, dear Dora, and I was so miserable about
      myself that I exaggerated your danger. I have seen by the papers that he
      has made a great success in life, and that old Stafford is very proud of
      him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret folded the letter in her lap and sat aflame with joy, staring
      with glowing eyes at the vacant air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like it? Is it nice, lady?&rdquo; the child asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very nice, and I thank you,&rdquo; she answered. The child said something,
      but she did not hear it. The pent-up ecstasy within her was like physical
      pain; she could have screamed to give it an outlet. She felt a womanly
      yearning to embrace the boy, and would have opened her arms to him had she
      not heard steps behind her. Looking over her shoulder, she saw Kenneth
      Galt approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dropped in at the front to see you,&rdquo; he said, with a bow. &ldquo;They told me
      you were out here.&rdquo; His eyes fell on the child, and a strange flare of
      inexpressible tenderness lighted his lack-lustre eyes as he drew a chair
      forward and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I like it here,&rdquo; she intoned, and her voice, in her own ears,
      sounded far off, and as if it had taken on the timbre of a new and exalted
      existence. She half feared that Galt would note it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem happy,&rdquo; he said, thoughtfully, &ldquo;and that is a condition that is
      most rare with humankind. I certainly envy a happy individual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am very happy,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;more so than I ever was in my life
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly envy you,&rdquo; he repeated, gloomily. &ldquo;I have given up all hope
      of even touching the hem of the good dame's garment.&rdquo; The boy had gone to
      him, and stood with his little hand on his father's knee, looking with
      trustful adoration into the dark, saturnine face above him. Something in
      the child's profile, now that Margaret held the glass of revelation to her
      eyes, showed kinship to its paternal prototype, and a dazzling dart of
      conviction flashed through her. At that instant she had a motherly
      instinct to draw the child from the contaminating touch of the man who had
      disowned it. His attitude of denial was a desecration to the holiness of
      parenthood, and in her soul she resented it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to me, Lionel,&rdquo; she said, gently. &ldquo;I want you to kiss me. Won't you,
      just once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child stared as if scarcely believing that he had heard aright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say, lady?&rdquo; he asked, as he lingered hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She repeated her words more tenderly than before, and there was a mist
      before her sight as he came toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like me now?&rdquo; he asked, wonderingly. &ldquo;Yes, and love you very, very
      much,&rdquo; she answered, huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you didn't ever so long at <i>first</i>; you didn't <i>yesterday</i>,
      when I asked you to see my church. You didn't just <i>this minute</i>,
      when I brought my mother's letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do now, ever and ever so much,&rdquo; she said, adopting his tone, and,
      taking him into her arms, she pressed him passionately to her breast and
      kissed him on his brow, on his cheeks, and on his red lips. Then, holding
      him in her arms, and with no word of explanation to Galt, she rose. &ldquo;Put
      your arms close around my neck,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and hug me tight. I am going
      to run over and see your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child complied, timidly, a delicate flush of appreciation on his
      mobile face. Then she put him down, and, still not looking at Galt, she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you needn't come, Lionel; I'll only be there a minute to return the
      letter. You may stay here and entertain your&mdash;your good friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galt, who had risen, stood looking after her for a moment, his countenance
      dark with the ever-constant despair within him. He felt the tiny,
      confident hands of his child as they pressed against his legs, and looked
      down into the sweetly smiling, upturned face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They <i>all</i> like me now,&rdquo; Lionel said. &ldquo;She was the only one that
      didn't, but she says she does <i>now</i>. She kissed me. Did you see her?
      Oh, she's so pretty! She is&mdash;no, she isn't, but she is <i>nearly</i>
      as pretty as my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galt sat down and drew the boy first to a seat on his knee and then into
      his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knows the truth,&rdquo; he said to himself, in a tone of desperate
      indifference to fate. &ldquo;Something in that letter told her.&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>S she passed
      through the gate at the end of the lawn, Margaret looked back and saw the
      child and its father seated together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is the one,&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;He of all men! And yet I might have
      known it; he has adored the child since the moment he first saw it there
      on the lawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dora saw her coming from her easel near the window of her studio, and
      stood in the hall awaiting her. Her face was aglow with expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without any word of greeting Margaret simply ran to her and threw her arms
      about her neck. &ldquo;Oh, you are <i>so</i> good, <i>so</i> noble!&rdquo; she cried.
      &ldquo;I see it all now, and I have been wofully wrong. Oh, Dora, I could not
      have treated you as I have all these miserable years if I had not thought&mdash;I
      actually thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know now what you thought,&rdquo; Dora broke in, a pained expression
      clutching her lips, as she drew Margaret into the studio. &ldquo;I don't know
      why I did not think of it sooner, but I didn't. Away back when my trouble
      was blackest I heard that Fred's name had been coupled with mine. I denied
      it then, and thought that was the end of it. After that, you see,&rdquo; she
      went on, with a shudder of repugnance to the topic, &ldquo;I buried myself here
      so completely that no outside gossip reached my ears. I had to guard my
      own secret, and I was afraid that even the slightest agitation of the
      matter might disclose the truth. I&mdash;I would have died rather than
      have had it known&mdash;all of it, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you sent me this letter?&rdquo; Margaret laid it on a table and stood
      staring gratefully into the beautiful face. &ldquo;You sent it, although you
      knew that it might&mdash;at least&mdash;lead me to&mdash;to wonder who&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I had to do it,&rdquo; the young artist interrupted, her glance averted.
      &ldquo;I could not bear to have you think Fred was anything but noble and true
      and good. Margaret, I cried for joy over the fine news in his letter. I
      couldn't believe you had snubbed the poor boy in New York for nothing. I
      was puzzled for a while, and then the horrible truth dawned on me. I hope
      he will never learn that he was so terribly misjudged. It would hurt him
      more than all else that has happened to him. They said he was bad,
      Margaret&mdash;wild, and a gambler, and all that; but to me he was like a
      sweet, thoughtful brother. If I'd only listened to his advice, I'd never
      have been situated like this; but I didn't. I thought I was very wise
      then. I have Lionel now, of course. He seemed to come to me like an angel
      of light out of a black sky of infinite pain. But if God will only show me
      a way to save him from future trouble, I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, I have made you cry!&rdquo; Margaret exclaimed, regretfully. &ldquo;I am so
      sorry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't give way often.&rdquo; Dora brushed the tears from her eyes. &ldquo;It is
      only when I think of what may come to my little darling. Perhaps we shall
      get to Paris before he is old enough to understand, and then all this will
      fade from his childish memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, you must go to Paris,&rdquo; Margaret said. &ldquo;I have more money than I
      need. Dora, surely you would not refuse to let me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no, no!&rdquo; Dora cried out. &ldquo;I couldn't think of it. What is done
      must be done by <i>me</i>, by <i>my</i> brain, and by <i>my</i> hands. God
      will surely let me atone in that way for my mistake. It is what I have
      prayed for night and day all these years, and the reward surely can't be
      far off.&rdquo; She forced a wan smile to her rigid face, and added: &ldquo;Then, like
      the Arabs, some night we'll fold our tents and silently steal away from
      old Stafford. Only the grocer-boy and the postman will know, at first, and
      then the last chapter of our life here will be written. It seems sad,
      doesn't it?&mdash;but it is sweet, so very, very sweet and soothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was crying. Without a word, she kissed Dora and went out. But she
      did not return home at once. She kept on down the little street on which
      the cottage stood till she came to another which led to the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed the stores, bowing to an acquaintance in a doorway or in a
      passing carriage, and went on to Walton's bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Walton in?&rdquo; she asked Toby Lassiter, at the cashier's window in
      the green wire grating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has just this minute stepped out,&rdquo; Toby answered. &ldquo;He will be right
      in. Won't you go to his office and wait?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, yes,&rdquo; she answered, and went back to the musty little room,
      taking a chair near the old man's desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a moment's delay, Toby grabbed his hat and went out in the street.
      He found the banker lounging around Pete Longley's grocery store, where he
      had an attentive audience. Toby knew better than to interrupt the old man
      when he was talking, so he waited for Walton to finish his remarks, which,
      judging by the steady gleam of the banker's eye, had some underlying
      motive; and, considering the fact that Pete was a noted gossip, Toby
      decided that his employer was simply and deliberately setting afloat
      certain reports that would be on every lip before nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; Toby heard him saying, &ldquo;I never was a man to let my right hand
      know what my left was doing in any deal whatsoever, and so, all this time,
      I have kept my own counsel in regard to where Fred was at, and why&mdash;why
      I sent him out there. He invested some of the scads that is coming to him
      in that big boom town and turned his money over as fast as a dog can trot.
      Boys, I'm actually ashamed to tell you fellows how rich he really is. I
      reckon you'd get an idea of how he's fixed if I was to say he has made
      more since he left here than I've raked and scraped together all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say!&rdquo; Pete Longley exclaimed. &ldquo;Well, that certainly is fine. I
      reckon he did it through his popularity. I never knew a chap that had as
      many friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he'll be back to shake hands with you all very soon now,&rdquo; Walton
      said, gratified at the way his fuse had ignited. &ldquo;I've been out to see him
      a time or two, but he has always been too busy to come this way; but he'll
      get here&mdash;he'll lay everything down and head this way some day before
      long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Walton caught sight of the breathless Toby at his elbow; he
      stepped out to the edge of the sidewalk, and bent down to hear what his
      clerk had to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's waiting for you in your office, Mr. Walton,&rdquo; Toby panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&mdash;not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I told her to sit down and I'd fetch you in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord, I reckon I'll get it in the neck, Toby!&rdquo; Walton's face was a
      veritable mask of gravity and concern. &ldquo;I reckon she's come to give the
      boy his walking-papers. I have thought it over till my head swims. No
      woman of her station and pride would ever let a man come back to her while
      a thing like that is hanging over him. If the woman and the child was dead
      and under ground, it might be different. She's come too quick to bear good
      news&mdash;a woman would tussle over a thing like that for a good month,
      and then ask for more time. No, the jig is up! I deserve it for the string
      of lies I was wrapping round that gang to make my case as good as
      possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved slowly into the bank, hung up his hat in the little hallway
      deliberately, and quite after the manner in which he went to meet business
      proposals, with his rough face grimly set against rejections and
      compromises. She was going to cast him down, but he'd show her that he was
      game. She had practically closed the matter during his interview with her,
      and had only delayed longer at his earnest request. No, she shouldn't
      chuckle over his defeat. He didn't know but what he'd throw out a hint
      that Fred wasn't really so very &ldquo;rampageous&rdquo; in the matter, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how do you do?&rdquo; he said, as he went in. She started to hold out her
      hand, but, not looking for such a movement, he failed to see it, and
      lunged toward his desk, where he sat and took up a pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I reckon,&rdquo; he began, awkwardly, &ldquo;you've' come to see me about&mdash;to
      say whether or not&mdash;that is, you remember, I said if you finally
      decided&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>have</i> decided, Mr. Walton.&rdquo; She rose and came and stood over him.
      Her voice was quivering; there was a blaze of burning joy in her face and
      eyes, but he did not see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you <i>have!</i> Well, it's for you to say whether you thought best
      or not. I reckon I went just a <i>little</i> mite beyond my authority up
      there, in my effort to conduct Fred's affairs for him, without, you
      understand&mdash;without his <i>free</i> consent. I only thought, maybe,
      if you would signify your willingness to overlook certain rather shady
      things, Fred might take it as a sort o'&mdash;sort o' all-round sign from
      <i>this</i> end&mdash;a sort of index of public opinion bearing on his
      particular case, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have decided, Mr. Walton,&rdquo; Margaret broke in. &ldquo;I have come to ask
      you to write to him. Tell him, please, that I'd like to see him. I feel
      sure that when he gets home he and I will fully understand each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, Miss Margaret, you don't mean&mdash;&rdquo; Simon stood up to
      his full height, his old eyes blinking in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do, Mr. Walton. I want to see him and talk to him. I don't know
      how to say it to <i>you</i>, but I am sure Fred will understand. Tell him
      that I&mdash;that I kissed you for his sake, there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And before Simon could avoid it she had thrown her arms around his neck
      and actually pressed her lips to his grizzled cheek. To add to his
      confusion, Toby hastily entered the room just as she was releasing her
      dumfounded captive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Toby gasped, his face ablaze with embarrassment, &ldquo;I didn't mean to;
      but the General is at the door in his carriage, and asked if you were in
      here. Of course, Miss Margaret, I hadn't the least idea but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don't let it get out, for all you do, Toby,&rdquo; Margaret laughed,
      merrily. &ldquo;Don't forget, Mr. Walton; by to-night's mail, sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the next instant she had floated out of the room, leaving the red-face
      banker under the perplexed stare of his apologetic clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She oughtn't to have done that!&rdquo; Walton growled, as he brushed the
      shoulders of his coat where her gloved hands had rested and stroked his
      tingling cheek. &ldquo;She had no business going as far as that. Women are such
      dad-dratted galoots when they get wound up in any matter. She seems
      willing for him to come. I'm not able to understand it, and I don't intend
      to try. They won't be long getting hitched if she goes at him in a
      whirlwind like that. Good Lord, I wouldn't have my wife know what she done
      just now for any man's pile! She'd make a scandal out of it, or break her
      neck trying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's safe in my hands, Mr. Walton,&rdquo; Toby said, with unconscious
      humor. &ldquo;<i>I'll</i> never tell it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You'll</i> never tell it? Who the devil asked you to hide it?&rdquo; Walton
      stormed. &ldquo;But I reckon she meant it to sort o' seal what she'd made up her
      mind to agree to, and she really is swallowing a pill, Toby, from any
      point of view. But it will make the boy powerful happy, and he will be on
      the wing as soon as he gets my report. Huh! I see his old stepdaddy's face
      now. He may try to keep him; but, shucks! I've got the old duck where the
      feathers are short. I've started a bang-up report in the boy's favor,
      Toby, and you can sort o' kick the ball along whenever it comes your way.
      We needn't mention that nasty business to him, neither; if Margaret can
      let bygones be bygones, surely the rest of us can.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">U</span>NDER a growing
      weight of uneasiness, combined with a sense of utter discontent with
      himself, Galt put Lionel down when he had half listened to his accusing
      prattle for an hour, and sought the shadowy solitude of his great house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Margaret Dealing knew, he told himself. That was plain from her
      change of manner. She knew the truth at last, and was now heaping upon him
      the silent, womanly contempt which he so eminently deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat at his open window and watched the shadows fall and sullenly creep
      across the lawn as the sunbeams receded, and the twilight of a close,
      sultry evening came on. He went down to supper when he was called, but he
      ate little and his loneliness seemed more oppressive there in the open
      gas-light, under the gaze of the observant and solicitous attendants.
      Taking a cigar, he went outside and began to walk up and down on the
      grass, now grimly fighting against the fate which, like some grim
      sea-monster, was clutching him with a million penetrating tentacles, and
      coiling round him as might some insidious reptile bent upon retributive
      torture. How had he dared to question the predominance of spirit over
      matter when this piteous appeal for the peace of his soul was oozing from
      the very fibre of his being?
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he saw Wynn Dearing emerge from the front door of his home,
      carrying a traveller's bag. Dearing rested the bag on the walk at his feet
      and stood looking down the street. Then, with his arms folded, he began to
      walk nervously to and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is going away,&rdquo; Galt speculated. &ldquo;He looks excited. I wonder if
      Margaret could have told him of her discovery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galt stood still, held to the ground by the sheer horror of the thought.
      Of all possible happenings, he had most dreaded his best friend's
      discovery of that particular thing. The young doctor had turned toward him
      and was approaching. He now held his head down and had clasped his hands
      tensely behind him. Suddenly, when quite near, he raised his eyes and
      recognized Galt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Kenneth!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn't know you were at home. Otherwise, I
      should have run in and said good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going somewhere, then?&rdquo; Galt said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Augusta for a few days,&rdquo; Dearing replied. &ldquo;I got a letter offering me
      a chance to do an important operation. I shall be glad to get away, even
      for so short a time as that. I almost wish, old man, that I could stay
      away forever. I used to love this town, but I hate it now. I hate anything
      that is heartless and totally blinded by money and power to all sense of
      justice and common decency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what's gone wrong?&rdquo; Galt inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong? The place is rotten to the core!&rdquo; Dearing burst out. &ldquo;Kenneth, a
      thing is going to be countenanced by the citizens of this town that would
      stain the character of the Dark Ages. Haven't you heard the news that has
      set every tongue to wagging like a thousand bell-clappers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven't heard anything out of the ordinary. You see, I am keeping
      so close here at home that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, old man, the lowest, poorest excuse for a man that old Stafford
      ever produced is coming back,&rdquo; Dearing broke it, furiously. &ldquo;Fred Walton,
      I mean. I didn't think he'd have the effrontery to show his face here
      again, but he has decided to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Galt exclaimed. But that was all he said, for Dearing went on,
      angrily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and the dastardly thing&mdash;the most outrageous fact about it all&mdash;is
      that every soul in the place is ready to receive him with open arms. He
      has made lots of money; he is rich; he has reformed, they say, and, idiots
      that they are, they have forgiven him. I have heard his return spoken of
      by a score of our very best citizens, and not one of them has even
      mentioned the crime that lies at his door&mdash;the crime that stands out
      to-day in a more damning light than it ever did. The brave, patient,
      suffering little woman&mdash;who is as high above him intellectually,
      morally, and every other way as the stars are above the earth&mdash;and
      that glorious child are to have another slap from his dirty, egotistical
      paw. He put her into prison and made her an exile with his nameless
      offspring, and yet he comes back like a royal prince. 'Wild oats,' they
      call his vile conduct, and they are ready to wipe it off his record. That
      is modern mankind for you, and, Kenneth, this one circumstance has come
      nearer to shaking my faith than anything that ever happened to me. If God
      can allow an insult like that to come to Dora Barry now, after all she has
      borne so sweetly, silently, and bravely, He can be no God of mine. I'll be
      through with the creeds, I tell you. I'll join your gang of scoffers and
      trot along wherever your black philosophy leads. Even my uncle has no
      protest to make, nor my sister, who I thought had given the scamp up in
      disgust. By George, she even looks happy over it! I don't want to meet him
      face to face. I don't know that I could control myself. She has given me
      no right to act as her defender; if she had, Kenneth, I'd take up her
      cause if it ended my career here forever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You? You?&rdquo; Galt gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I. Listen, old man. You are my best friend, and I feel like telling
      some one. I feel that it would be a sort of tribute of respect to her
      worthiness. I presume you, like all the rest, think that I never have had
      any preference for any particular woman, but I have had, and I am not
      ashamed of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was a boy of thirteen or so, and Dora was about eight, we used to
      play together. Even at that age I had an eye for beauty, and she was the
      prettiest child that ever lived. We called ourselves sweethearts. Her old
      father used to get us to sit for him in his studio, and he would talk to
      us as only such a beautiful soul could to children. He used to sigh and
      say that she would be a pauper, and that I would grow up a prince, for an
      artist could not leave his daughter money, and my father was said to be
      well-to-do. Even at that early age I denied the possibility of such a
      thing making any difference between her and me, and when she grew up into
      such beautiful girlhood, and was studying art under her father, I
      determined to make something of myself, aside from the inheritance which
      was to come to me. So I went in for medicine and surgery, and she kept to
      art, saying that she would earn a living for her parents when they became
      old. But he died away off in Paris, whither his dreams led him, while I
      was at college, and when I came home I found that she had grown away from
      me. It was a great blow, for I had been constantly thinking of her. To me
      she was the very glory of her sex, and it was mostly her influence that
      made me what I am. I have seen many women since then, but never her equal
      from any point of view. I went with her occasionally after that, but it
      was more to become accustomed to her loss than in the hope of winning her
      regard. Then the awful, unmentionable thing came out. You know what I
      mean. That man had won her confidence, won her heart&mdash;how, God only
      knows, but he had&mdash;and dealt her a back-handed blow, and left her
      helpless, miserable. I tried then, harder than ever, to tear her image out
      of my heart, but I couldn't. My professional duties called me into the
      saddened home to which no other soul was admitted. I saw that even in her
      blighted womanhood she was fulfilling every promise given by her youth.
      Instead of sinking lower, she was blooming like a flower under snow. I
      suppose I shall go through the rest of my life with her personality woven
      into the very warp and woof of my being. But knowing her has strengthened
      and broadened me. She is beautiful, pure, and spiritual&mdash;God's denial
      of the social law held over her. Only shallow men judge women by physical
      mistakes made in the unselfish purity of over-confidence. She will never
      call on me for the aid I'd gladly give, and I can't insult her strange
      widowhood by offering it. She has her heart set on going to Paris to live
      and study, as her father did. She thinks she can bury herself there before
      Lionel is old enough to realize his condition, and that he may never know
      the truth. It is a beautiful dream, but it can never be realized.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A horse and buggy stopped at the gate, and Doctor Beaman, who was driving,
      leaned over and called out, excitedly: &ldquo;I'm fifteen minutes late, Wynn;
      you may miss the train. Hurry! hurry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a fact; I must go. Good-bye, old man.&rdquo; Galt held on to Dearing's
      hand firmly, almost desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, I have something to say,&rdquo; he began&mdash;&ldquo;something that simply
      must be said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, Wynn, hurry, hurry!&rdquo; Doctor Beaman was heard calling out,
      impatiently. &ldquo;You don't want to lie over in Atlanta. I'll have to go in a
      gallop, and <i>then</i> may miss your train! Hurry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, just a moment,&rdquo; Galt implored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know you are sympathetic.&rdquo; Dealing, misunderstanding, ran for his
      bag, with the wordless Galt shambling along at his side. &ldquo;I couldn't have
      told you all that if you hadn't taken such a liking for the poor little
      kid. Good-bye, good-bye, only don't join the gang of fools that will laud
      that scamp to the skies when he comes&mdash;that is all I ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you <i>must</i> listen!&rdquo; Galt cried out. &ldquo;I must tell you now that&mdash;&rdquo;
       But Dearing had darted away. The gate closed after him, and Galt saw him
      climbing into the buggy even while it was in motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he'll know it soon enough,&rdquo; the lonely man thought. &ldquo;The facts will
      come out now. Walton will hear the report when he gets back, and Dora will
      declare him innocent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galt went into the dimly lighted hallway of his house and ascended the
      stairs. There was nothing to do now, he told himself. The world that had
      admired him, the men and women who had entrusted him with the investment
      of their savings in his various schemes, would stare and doubt their
      senses. They would shun him&mdash;one and all they would shun him as they
      would some loathsome thing; he had used their money well, but their profit
      had been made by a man who had known no honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered his room, turned up the light, and critically examined his
      ghastly image in the mirror on his bureau. What a gashed and blearing mask
      to all that lay behind it! How could it go on? How could he bear with it
      another day? Even if he could lay it aside in sleep to-night, the
      heartless dawn would reveal it all the more relentlessly. Suddenly out of
      the turmoil of his emotions a grim resolve rose and fastened itself on
      him. His suicide would be his confession&mdash;his belated exoneration of
      the man who so long had borne the stigma in his stead. In a small drawer
      in the bureau lay a revolver. It was loaded in all of its six chambers,
      and as he took the weapon out he almost fondled it in his clammy hand. In
      the morning his servants would find his body, and the truth would be out.
      He would close the door and windows that the revolver's report might be
      smothered. But he started; there was the child, his helpless child, to
      whom he had given life&mdash;and <i>such</i> a life!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lionel, Lionel!&rdquo; he said, aloud. &ldquo;My son, my son, my beautiful brave boy,
      who loves me in spite of what I have done against him! Will he grow up and
      understand? Will he pardon his misguided father, or blush for shame at the
      thought of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the revolver still in his hand, he sank into a chair near a window
      and gazed out into the star-filled sky. Suddenly he started. Whence had
      come the thought? He could not tell, but a new and dazzling conviction was
      on him like light streaming through the gates of Paradise. Kill himself?
      How absurd the thought! He might dash his bleeding, lifeless body to the
      earth, but he, himself, would remain a deathless witness to the act.
      Nothing in the shape of matter, no force known to science, could possibly
      put out of existence the yearning for atonement within him. Nothing so
      divine as that could die. Such a thing was from the Eternity that had
      created Eternity. He threw the revolver on his bed, and drew a deep,
      delectable breath. His now entranced vision seemed to extend further out
      into the world-filled void above him. He stood up, panting from the sheer
      ravage his new hope had wrought upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eternity! Eternity!&rdquo; he whispered, in reverential awe. &ldquo;Now I see&mdash;the
      scales have fallen from my sight. I see! Thank God, I see! I understand!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Kenneth Galt
      waked the next morning it was with the new sense of having slept long and
      restfully for the first time in years. The sun was streaming into his
      windows from the golden east; the cool air seemed crisp and invigorating;
      in the boughs of the trees close by birds were flitting about and singing
      merrily. The dew-wet sward, bespangled with a myriad of sun-born gems,
      stretched away into the gauzy mist which hung over the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is glorious&mdash;glorious!&rdquo; he cried, in ecstasy. &ldquo;She may refuse,
      but I shall never desist till I have won her forgiveness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After he had breakfasted in the big dining-room, now no longer solitary,
      sombre, or accusing, he went directly down to Mrs. Barry's cottage. With a
      strange, buoyant lightness of step he entered the little gate, fastened
      the latch with a calm hand, and went up the steps and rapped on the closed
      door, seeing, as he stood waiting, the face of Mrs. Chumley, as the
      washerwoman peered curiously over the fence at him from her wood-pile,
      where she was wielding a gapped and dull-edged axe. The door was opened by
      Mrs. Barry, who could not disguise her surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to see your daughter, Mrs. Barry,&rdquo; he said, humbly, as he
      stood uncovered before her. &ldquo;I hope she will receive me; I have something
      important to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's not here. But don't stand there,&rdquo; the old woman said; &ldquo;somebody
      might see you and wonder. Come into the parlor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led the way, and he followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she is not here,&rdquo; she repeated, when they were in the simply
      furnished room. &ldquo;She and Lionel went very early to the swamp over the hill
      near the river. She had some sketching to do, and he wished to go along.
      You say you want to see her. Of course, you understand that such a request
      is unexpected, to say the least, and, as I am her mother&mdash;&rdquo; The
      speaker seemed at a loss for words to express her meaning, and paused
      helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad of this opportunity to see you first,&rdquo; Galt said, humbly. &ldquo;Mrs.
      Barry, I've come to beg her, on my knees if need be, to be my wife.
      Perhaps you may understand; I hope you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; And the old woman sank into a rocking-chair and stared up at him.
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed again, her wrinkled hand pressed against her thin
      breast. &ldquo;You mean that, do you, Kenneth Galt? Well, I have never mentioned
      it to her, but I thought it might come. I read faces fairly well, and I
      saw, even at a distance, the spiritual despair in yours. Knowing what you
      were responsible for, I felt that your solitary life in your lonely house
      would bring results, for good or bad. At first I thought you might resume&mdash;might
      make dishonorable proposals; but when I saw you and Lionel together so
      often I began to count on other things&mdash;I began to <i>pray</i> for
      other things. You don't look like a mean man, Kenneth Galt; and I can't
      find it in my heart to reproach you. Besides, it is pitiful to think
      about, considering the child's future; but she may have you now right
      where you had her once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;you mean!&rdquo; he exclaimed, aghast, as he bent over her chair
      and stared into her calm face. &ldquo;You mean that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that it may be too late,&rdquo; she interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late?&rdquo; He sank into a chair in front of her, and, pale and quivering
      in every limb, swung his hat between his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; she is my daughter, but she is above me in a thousand ways. She
      suffered untold agonies after you desert&mdash;after you left Stafford,
      and all through her trouble; but when the baby came, and we were all shut
      up here away from human sight, the choicest blessings from on high seemed
      to fall on her. With her close work in her studio, and her devotion to the
      child, she grew into something more of heaven than of earth. I suppose
      there is such a thing as rising too high to love, in a <i>human</i> sort
      of way, and I tremble when I think of how she may now take your proposal.
      I want her to be sensible and think of the boy's interests, but the idea
      of helping him in <i>just that way</i> may be&mdash;be repulsive to her.
      She's done without your aid all these years, you see, Kenneth Galt. She
      has leaned on a Higher Power than any earthly one, and has already
      received her reward. You knew her as she was once, but not as she is now.
      She was hardly more than a child then. Her father used to say she would be
      a great genius, and I think she really is. Her isolation from mankind has
      done her more good in one way than harm. It has put something into her
      work that couldn't have got there any other way. Only yesterday a letter
      came from a high authority on art&mdash;But I have no right to speak of
      her private affairs. If she sees fit to tell you about it she may. That's
      another matter. She has never been ashamed, as this town, no doubt, thinks
      she is. She looked on what passed between you and her before the trouble
      as a true marriage in the sight of God. It wasn't the way persons
      generally look at such matters, but she wasn't a common, ordinary person,
      and she didn't think the man she loved was&mdash;that is, I mean she
      thought you looked at it <i>exactly as she did</i>. She took you at your
      word. If what I say pains you, I'm sorry. I must be blunt to express what
      is in me, for I have long ago justified her. If she had been worldly
      minded, back there when she was glorying in the secret between you and
      her, she would have had worldly caution and forethought. You may get
      forgiveness even from her, Kenneth Galt, in time, but there can be nothing
      quite as unforgivable in the sight of God, it seems to me, as taking
      advantage of <i>just that sort of faith</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The light of hope had died out of Galt's parchment-like face. He dropped
      his horrified gaze to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;I am too late!&rdquo; and sat as if stunned. &ldquo;I was never
      up to her level. It was only her girlish fancy that told her I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't know!&rdquo; Mrs. Barry said, almost sympathetically. &ldquo;Now that you
      feel as you do, her old trust might come back. There is one thing that has
      touched her, I'll tell you that much, for certain, and that has been your
      love for Lionel. One day I caught her shedding tears over it as she stood
      concealed by the window-curtain watching you play with him in the swing.
      If anything ever brings her back to you, it will be that one thing. He
      loves you, too; he is always talking of you, and, if I am any judge, she
      rather likes to hear it. It may be that&mdash;it may not; I never can be
      sure I am reading her right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose. &ldquo;I am going to find her now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;At any rate, she shall
      know how I feel. She may spurn me, but from this day on I shall devote my
      life to her interests and those of our child.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>NTO the wood, a
      wild, unbrageous tract of land lying back of the cottage, he strode, full
      of ponderous fears as to the outcome of his undertaking, and yet vaguely
      buoyed up by the natural beauty on all sides. Soon the town lay behind
      him; only the low hum of its traffic, the occasional clanging of a
      locomotive's bell, the whistle of an engine at a factory, the clatter of a
      dray followed him. The reverent, almost peaceful thought was borne in upon
      him that the meandering, little-used path he was pursuing had been
      traversed many times by Dora. In that secluded and picturesque spot she
      had breathed in the inspiration which had lifted her far above those by
      whom she had been misunderstood and traduced. Along that path she and his
      child, perchance, had plucked flowers through the years in which he had
      shunned them&mdash;denied them before the world, whose good opinion he had
      coveted to his moral undoing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a mile from the cottage the path began to descend to the river
      valley, a vast swampy tangle of dense undergrowth. Here in the marshes,
      impassable during the overflow of winter and spring, but now dank, cool,
      and seductive, were many nooks of indescribable beauty. Here moss-grown
      willows bowed over seeping, crystal pools and silently trickling water.
      There were the armies of cattails, the solitary clumps of broom-sedge, the
      banks of delicate ferns, and the pond-lilies which had formed the
      background of her pictures. There she had found the wild rose-bushes, the
      papaw, the sumac, and the mazes of grape and muscadine vines into the
      reproduction of which she had poured her crushed and yet awakening soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he came upon her seated on a mossy bank, her closed sketch-book
      on her knee. She was not working, but, with the end of her pencil at her
      parted lips, she sat watching Lionel, whom he could see plucking flowers
      and colored leaves not far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, don't go any farther, darling boy!&rdquo; he heard her call out, in tones
      the mellow sweetness of which shot through him like a delectable pain.
      &ldquo;You might wander away, and then mother's boy would be lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sheltered from her view by hanging vines and the lowering branches of a
      beech-tree, Galt peered out at her. How could he have been so blinded?&mdash;so
      densely unappreciative of her? Where in all his experience had he known a
      creature so beautiful in soul, mind, and body? And yet he had thrown her
      down and trampled on her and left her covered with the mire and slime of
      his own making. He smothered a groan of blended self-contempt and despair.
      Her mother had doubted his ever regaining her regard, and Mrs. Barry knew
      her best. The girl had been at his mercy once, and he had not hesitated to
      strike; now she had the upper hand. What would she do? How would she
      receive his proposal?&mdash;what would she say? Would her soulful eyes
      blaze under the fires of just retaliation? Would her magnetic voice ring
      with the contempt she must so long have felt?
    </p>
    <p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0008.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Noiselessly treading the dank, green moss which lay between him and her,
      he was close to her before she was aware of his presence. Then she glanced
      up and saw him; there was a fluttering, shrinking look in her long-lashed
      eyes, in which he read the hurried hope that the meeting was purely
      accidental; to his horror, he also read in the simple act of reaching for
      her hat, which lay by her side, that she intended to avoid any sort of
      intercourse with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the agony of this fear sounding in his voice, he cried, imploringly:
      &ldquo;Please don't run away! I have been to your house to see you; your mother
      told me you were here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she <i>wouldn't</i>,&rdquo; Dora said, pale and surprised. &ldquo;She knows that
      I don't want to&mdash;to meet <i>any one</i> here. It isn't fair, Kenneth&mdash;you
      know it isn't! It is taking a mean, low advantage of me, after all that
      has happened. It is cowardly, and I won't stand it. You will leave me
      instantly, or <i>I</i> shall go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forgive me, you are right, Dora!&rdquo; he cried, in dismay. &ldquo;But there is
      something I must say, and even your mother thought I might venture to see
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is to offer me money for my boy, as you did in the contemptible
      letter I burned unanswered, soon after his birth, you will be wasting
      time,&rdquo; she said, wrathful, in her cold, unrelenting beauty. &ldquo;I can't
      accept money, even for him, which was earned as the price of his mother's
      public disgrace. He is mine, and he shall be mine to the end. I can work
      for him till he is old enough to work for me. We don't need you&mdash;neither
      of us do, Kenneth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made you angry,&rdquo; he said, quivering from head to foot, his
      anguished eyes fixed on hers. &ldquo;Listen, Dora. Last night I planned to kill
      myself to get out of the agony into which my awakened love for you and my
      new love for Lionel has drawn me. I was ready to do it, for to that moment
      I had no fear of God or eternity; but a change came over me. Hope dawned;
      I don't know why, but it did, and I made a determination to spend the
      remainder of my life in your service, and in that of my child, for he is
      mine as much as he is yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my new hope seemed to fairly set the world on fire. It was showered
      down from heaven like the forgiveness of God upon a blinded creature
      buried in the mire of sin. Ever since I sold my honor the night my
      ambition conquered me, I have been a cursed, isolated soul. It must have
      been the hand of God that led me back here to Stafford. I love Lionel with
      all my heart, and I know now, in spite of my contradictory conduct, that I
      have loved you all this time. Last night Wynn Dearing told me that it is
      your wish to go to Paris&mdash;you, your mother, and the child&mdash;and
      the thought came to me that if you would be my wife we could go and remain
      there a few years, and return here to spend the rest of our lives, and
      thus regain the happiness we've lost. Oh, don't turn from me, Dora! You
      must, oh, you must give me a chance! God knows it is my duty, and you must
      not stand between me and that. I can wait for the return of your respect,
      even if it is for years. But give me a chance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had turned her face from him, and he could not tell what effect his
      appeal had had upon her; but he saw that her soft, white fingers were
      clinched tightly on her knee. Suddenly she looked him squarely in the
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you make it so <i>hard</i> for me!&rdquo; she said, gently. &ldquo;I knew you
      were not a happy man. I saw the shadow of spiritual death in your
      countenance the day I met you at Dearing's. Yes, the child is yours, as
      well as he is mine. God has made him a part of you, as he is a part of me.
      And he loves you, Kenneth, he loves you&mdash;and admires you above all
      men. Young as he is, it would actually pain him to be separated from you.
      And you are asking me to be your wife!&rdquo; She shrugged her shoulders, her
      proud lip quivered, and she looked away. &ldquo;You are asking me, and <i>now!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Dora, to be my wife before the world, as you have been in God's
      sight all these years. I am willing to crawl in the dust at your feet. You
      are far above me. You were that when I blindly deserted you, and I can
      never be worthy of your forgiveness, but I would die for a chance to serve
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How sad it all is!&rdquo; she sighed, her glance on the ground. &ldquo;What a mere
      blown-about straw I have been! What a grim thing for a proud woman to
      decide! You deserted me once to save a paltry sum of money&mdash;a worldly
      ambition; you want me back to <i>save your soul</i>&mdash;that expresses
      it, Kenneth. But I can't consent. I am simply human&mdash;and a woman. My
      pride won't let me&mdash;the pride that every woman has who holds herself
      erect. You sold yourself once, and you are now asking me to do the same.
      Your price was a successful railroad and the plaudits of a few people&mdash;the
      price paid to me would be the future welfare of my child. I am expected to
      salve the wounds of a torn and mangled womanhood with the realization that
      I am providing for my boy. There is no pain keener than the fear that
      one's offspring may suffer what we ourselves have been through, and I'd
      give my soul to see Lionel happy in the time to come, but I can't bring it
      about in the way you ask. I simply can't! I loved you, Kenneth, before
      that unspeakable cloud fell between us, but I was only a girl then, and
      during all the years that have passed since I have given you no place at
      all in my heart. We are, in fact, meeting to-day as strangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. I know it is true so far as it touches <i>you</i>,&rdquo; he said, with
      a deep sigh, &ldquo;for your love died with your respect for me, but my love has
      never died, Dora. I smothered it for a time, in my mad ambition, but there
      was no act of yours to weaken it, and so it lived and grew till it has
      overpowered me. I love you now, strange as it may sound to you, ten
      thousand times more than I ever did. You may turn from me with a shudder
      and as a thing to be loathed; but I shall never cease to watch over you
      and strive to protect you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't say any more,&rdquo; she said, as she tied the tape round her portfolio
      and gathered up her pencils. &ldquo;I don't want to pain you; but I can't do
      what you ask, even&mdash;even for Lionel's sake. He and I and his granny
      <i>may</i> go to Paris some day, but we don't want you with us, Kenneth. I
      want to leave absolutely <i>everything</i> behind. You must be dead to us;
      there is no other way&mdash;no other possible way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned his fixed gaze away, that she might not see the look of agony
      which had overspread his face. She sat still and silent for several
      minutes; then he saw her draw herself up excitedly, look about anxiously,
      and rise to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, where is Lionel?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;He was there in the bushes when you
      came. Oh, he may have wandered off and be lost! There are some very
      dangerous places along the river-bank!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see him! Don't be alarmed!&rdquo; Galt said, indicating a spot beyond a clump
      of bushes. &ldquo;He's all right; I'll bring him to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said, coldly, and she sank back rigidly on the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned a moment later with Lionel in his arms. She could see, as she
      swept them with a hurried glance, that Galt was pressing the child close
      against his breast with a look of despair in his white face. Reaching
      Dora, Galt was lowering the child to the ground when Lionel clung tightly
      round his neck, pressing his little hand against his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; Lionel asked, anxiously. &ldquo;Mamma, he can't talk. He
      tries, but he can't; he is trembling all over; he is about to cry. What is
      the matter with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reaching up, and without a word, Dora took the child into her arms, and,
      holding him across her lap as if he had been an infant, she bent over his
      face to kiss him. Presently she looked up at Galt, and her proud lip
      trembled as she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Kenneth, fate is handling us strangely. I spoke harshly just now, for
      I can see that you are suffering. I wish I could be less human. After all
      my dreams, I am of the earth, earthy. I am no higher than a worm of this
      soil, after all the heights I thought I had climbed. But I can't help
      myself. I could never forget. I might try throughout eternity, but I'd
      never, never forget&mdash;forget that I offered myself wholly, body and
      soul, and that you refused to&mdash;to take me when I was in trouble. It
      may be sinful to look at it so, but I simply can't see it otherwise. You
      must really go now. Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he echoed, in his throat. &ldquo;I am going away to-morrow, and I
      promise never to intrude myself upon either of you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Good-bye?'&mdash;you said 'good-bye!'&rdquo; Lionel suddenly sat up in his
      mother's lap and stared from his great, startled eyes, his beautiful mouth
      puckered up and quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have to go away,&rdquo; Galt faltered, his glance averted. &ldquo;I only came
      to spend a short time at Stafford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you told me you never would go away from me,&rdquo; the child persisted.
      &ldquo;Don't you remember the day I fell and hurt my knee, and you washed it and
      put the medicine on it? Don't you remember you kissed me, and hugged me,
      and wanted me to kiss you, and said if I'd promise to be your little boy
      you would always stay with me? How can I be your little boy if&mdash;if
      you go off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the mother and father met in the strangest stare that ever
      passed between two mortal creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can always love you if I can't be with you,&rdquo; Galt faltered, conscious
      of the emptiness of his words. &ldquo;I can always love you and think what a
      plucky little boy you are, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; His voice trailed away
      into nothingness. A sob rose in his throat and choked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want you to <i>stay!</i>&rdquo; The child was crying now, with his chubby
      hands to his eyes. Suddenly Dora, with a desperate movement, pressed him
      to her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not play on his feelings that way!&rdquo; she cried, fiercely, casting
      a significant glance toward the town. &ldquo;Go, please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed low, a look of death on his face. She pressed the head of the
      sobbing child to her breast, and firmly held it there with her beautiful
      white hand. &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she said, with the dignity and calmness of an
      offended queen. &ldquo;Good-bye&mdash;forever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and moved away. A few paces from her, before the trees had
      obscured her from his sight, he looked back and saw her with Lionel in her
      arms. Her exquisite face was pressed consolingly against the golden head.
      She was whispering to the child and rocking back and forth, as if he were
      a babe on her breast.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N his left,
      farther away from the town, and about a mile distant, stood a small
      mountain. Dark-red as to soil, bristling with sandstone bowlders, sparcely
      grown with pines and thorny locust-trees, and gashed by rain-washed
      gullies, it rose majestically against the cloud-flecked blue of infinite
      space beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly knowing why he did so, Galt turned his face toward it and strode
      on, vaguely conscious that he was battling against the soul-calamity which
      had beset him as a dumb beast might fight for its physical life. Around
      the sloping base of the mountain lay old worn-out fields, now given over
      to the riotous possession of anything which would take root upon its soil.
      There was no path leading to the seldom visited elevation, but with his
      eyes constantly on the solitary finger of earth he climbed over the old
      rail-fence encompassing the land, and forged his way through the dense
      undergrowth, now ploughing his feet through a matting of heather and
      dewberry-vines, or plunging unexpectedly into some weed-hidden spring or
      fresh-water stream. Between him and the mountain ran a creek, and he
      suddenly found himself at a spot on the banks of it, where, as a boy, home
      on his vacations, he used to fish. But it had changed, he told himself, as
      everything else had changed&mdash;he was a man now, but <i>such</i> a man!
    </p>
    <p>
      Crossing the creek on a foot-log formed from the fallen corpse of a giant
      oak he had once known, he walked onward. The land was now sloping sharply
      upward, and his way was less impeded. The air was becoming more rarefied,
      the view on either side and behind him was unfolding more rapidly in the
      hazy distance. The sun, which had been beating on him mercilessly, was now
      behind a drifting cloud, and the cool breezes of a higher altitude fanned
      his flushed face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally he reached a flat, jutting bowlder near the top, and, exhausted
      from the inconsiderate tax on his muscles, he sank down panting. There lay
      old Stafford nearest at hand, and beyond stretched out the new town under
      its web of smoke, the besmudged handwriting of mercantile progress. His
      brain had fostered the idea, and made it practicable. Reaching out
      southward, in the sunlight, like two threads of silver, lay the great
      steel highway which his foresight and ambition had brought into existence.
      His fancy pictured with lightning flashes the growing villages and towns,
      as he had seen them on the opening day when he, like an emperor of a
      conquered territory, had been escorted over it. The moment had given him
      the thrill of gratified avarice and the empty glory of conquest, but the
      eyes of the eager throngs which had gazed upon him in wonder and envy that
      day saw nothing of the cancer which even then was eating into the vitals
      of his higher nature. Then&mdash;But why contemplate it? The juggernaut of
      relentless Right had ground him under its wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      He locked his arms over his knees, lowered his head, and groaned in sheer
      despair. If Dora had only given him a bare chance! But she hadn't, and
      now, loved as woman never was loved before, desired in spirit and body as
      woman never was desired by man, she had coldly, firmly put him from her.
      The sight of her as she sat holding his child in her arms, and spurning
      him as was her right to spurn him, would haunt him into and through the
      Eternity which had now become such a hopeless reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly raising his eyes to the relentless blue above, he tried to frame
      a prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God, have mercy!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Show me, a sinner, a way out of the
      darkness of my damnation. Give them to me, that I may atone by my conduct
      to them throughout my life. Soften her heart, O God, and open her eyes to
      the depths of my woe! I have suffered, I will suffer on to the end, but
      give me my wife and child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noon came and passed, but he had no thought of thirst or of hunger. He
      remained there on the rock and watched the sun go down, and saw the soft
      veil of coming darkness thicken over the earth. Now old Stafford lay in
      darkness, save for the dazzling circles of light where the arc-lamps swung
      across the streets and were grouped like a constellation in the square. He
      waited till the town clock had struck nine; then, still without sense of
      fatigue or hunger, he went down, now with considerable difficulty, owing
      to the darkness of the incline.
    </p>
    <p>
      He managed to reach his front gate without meeting any one, and was
      entering when he saw the figure of a woman emerge from the veranda and
      come slowly down the walk. Could it be one of the servants? he asked
      himself. But his answer was the recognition of the woman herself. It was
      Mrs. Barry. She paused, unable, it seemed, to formulate what she had to
      say, so sudden was the meeting, and his heart sank lower, as the thought
      came to him that something might have happened to Dora or the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to see you,&rdquo; she began, pushing back the bonnet which had
      partially obscured her face. &ldquo;Your servants told me they didn't know where
      you were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wanted to see <i>me?</i>&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Has anything gone wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is not <i>that</i>,&rdquo; the woman said, leading the way toward a
      clump of cedars on the grass, as if from the sensitive fear of meeting
      some one on the walk. &ldquo;My daughter and the child came home at noon. I saw
      from her looks that she was troubled over something, and that Lionel had
      been crying, from the marks on his face; but I did not question either of
      them. All this afternoon she did not speak of you, but to-night, after she
      had put the boy to sleep, she came into my room and sat down near me. I
      knew she was in awful struggle over something. She began telling me, in a
      slow, halting voice, of all that you had said. She is my only child,
      Kenneth Galt, but I don't understand her any better than if she were not
      of my flesh and blood. I never fully understood her father. I suppose no
      practical-minded person can comprehend those who live in the imagination,
      surrounded by ideals which become real to them. She began to go over the
      whole history of her trouble from the very first, and she never left out a
      single detail. She summed it all up in the most marvellous manner. My
      heart ached for her as it never had before. She wants to do right, she
      says, and she knows what would be right and self-sacrificing on her part,
      but she says she simply can't conquer the offended pride within her. She
      has had trouble and we are poor, but there never was born a queen with
      more pride of womanhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Galt gasped, as he stared at her. &ldquo;I know; I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I tried to advise her,&rdquo; Mrs. Barry went on. &ldquo;At first it was like
      talking to a person born deaf, but finally she began to listen, for, as a
      last resort, I was holding up the child's interests. I spoke of what a
      glorious thing a trip to Paris would be&mdash;to stay there as long as we
      liked, and to be able to come home again, for we do love it here, and I am
      sure the people would be kind in their view of it. I reminded her that
      once, when we asked Lionel what he had rather have than anything on earth,
      he had said that, <i>first</i>, he wanted a father like other children,
      and, <i>next</i>, that he wanted to be where he could have playmates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can't bear it, Mrs. Barry!&rdquo; Galt groaned. &ldquo;If there is anything
      under high heaven I could do to rectify my mistake, I'd give my life to do
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, Kenneth, and I am going to say something that may surprise
      you. I don't harbor any ill-feeling toward you. I simply can't. Living so
      close with Dora has lifted me up in spiritual things. I can't have
      anything but pity for the consequences of sin and temptation. What you did
      wasn't a proof that you didn't love my child. It only proved that the
      temptation you had, at the moment of your fall, kept you from realizing
      what you would lose. That's all. I believe you loved her then, that you
      did even after you left her, and I am sure that you do now more than ever;
      in fact, I made that plain to her. I think she sees it, too, <i>in her way</i>;
      but it doesn't help her overcome her pride. I am sorry for her&mdash;more
      so than I ever imagined I could be for a woman under any trial. She is
      pulled many ways by duty, and she is fairly in an agony, undecided as to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Undecided?</i> Did you say that?&rdquo; Galt leaned forward eagerly, his
      lips quivering, as he waited breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she is undecided. You see, things have come to such a focus that we
      must leave here. She has just learned that Fred Walton has been falsely
      accused by many persons, and she always liked him. He is coming back home,
      and she wants to clear his name, and yet she shrinks from having her
      private affairs brought in public view again. She said, herself, that if
      she could get her own consent to become your wife, then everybody would
      understand the truth, and not blame him. Then there is the child&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Lionel!&rdquo; Galt panted. &ldquo;We must save him, and we can&mdash;we can, if
      Dora could only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knows that full well,&rdquo; the woman said, passing her gaunt hand over
      her withered mouth and swallowing the rising lump in her throat. &ldquo;If you
      only could have&mdash;have heard what I did to-night it would have wrung
      tears from your eyes. Lionel had waked up, and she had to go to him. He
      couldn't sleep for what was on his mind. Kenneth Galt, that little angel
      was simply begging his mother not to let you go away&mdash;think of it,
      actually pleading for you! He had heard you say you were going, and, in
      some way, he fancied Dora could persuade you to stay. He cried till his
      little pillow was wet. He told her he loved you, that you had said he was
      your little boy, and that he wanted to be with you always. I heard her
      pleading with him and arguing, but through it all his little voice would
      continue to cry out that it should not be so&mdash;that he wanted <i>you</i>,
      and that <i>you</i> wanted <i>him</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless him!&rdquo; burst from the lips of the bowed man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finally he dropped to sleep,&rdquo; Mrs. Barry went on, &ldquo;and slept, still
      sobbing, as children do when wrought up high, and she left him and came
      again to me. Poor thing! She was simply undone&mdash;conquered! She put
      her head in my lap and burst out crying. She sobbed and sobbed a long
      time, and then I asked her if she would let <i>me</i> manage it. She knew
      what I meant&mdash;exactly what I meant, for she became like a lump of
      clay in my lap. For a long time she lay like that, hardly breathing. Then
      I told her of what a wonderful influence she had been to me in opening my
      eyes, old as I am, to the beauty of a higher, spiritual life, and that in
      holding back, as she was now doing, and refusing to pardon a repentant
      man, even when the happiness of her own child was at stake, she was going
      backward instead of forward. She seemed to realize it. She sat up
      straight, and the old light of sweetness and gentleness seemed to dawn in
      her face. 'I'll simply put myself in your hands, mother,' she said&mdash;'in
      your hands!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I broke down and cried in pure joy, Kenneth Galt. Then what do you think?
      I heard her go back to her room, and knew that the child had waked. I am
      not sure; but I think she waked him purposely, for she never could bear to
      have him go to sleep unhappy. I heard her telling him about the beauty of
      Paris&mdash;about its streets, its boulevards, and its parks; its
      buildings; its statuary and pictures, and of the pretty children who were
      to be his friends. She laughed like a happy child&mdash;they were always
      like two children, anyway&mdash;when she told him about crossing the ocean
      in a great ship, and of the high waves, deep water, and big fish. But he
      stopped her with a question. What do you think it was, Kenneth? He wanted
      to know if <i>you</i> were going? I knew she hesitated, her pride closing
      her lips, even there alone with her child. She wouldn't answer his
      question. Then I heard Lionel say plainly, and there was a strange sort of
      stubborness in his little voice: 'Well, I don't want to go; he would not
      want me to leave him; he said so once; he said he would never leave <i>me</i>,
      and I wasn't to leave <i>him</i>. Is he going, mother?' he kept asking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I heard her say, 'Yes, darling, he is going&mdash;now you can
      sleep!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said that? Did she say that?&rdquo; Galt cried, his whole despondent being
      aflame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it is settled, Kenneth. Perhaps, in time, you and she will be
      thoroughly happy together. I don't know, but I hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; Galt said, fervently, and, taking the old woman's hand, he
      wrung it in an ecstasy of delight. &ldquo;I only wanted a chance, Mrs. Barry. I
      shall devote my life to all of you, and we can be happy&mdash;gloriously
      happy over there. She shall be our queen, and Lionel our little prince.
      I'll have this old house kept in order, and some day we'll come back to
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then here is my plan,&rdquo; Mrs. Barry said. &ldquo;Meet us in Atlanta the day after
      to-morrow, and we shall be ready to sail. I'll let you know what hotel we
      go to. The news will come back from there, but we sha'n't be here during
      the reception of it. Now, I'm glad, for your sake as well as ours, that it
      is all going to turn out well. I want to see you happy. You have suffered
      enough, and so has she. As for me, I never was so happy in my life. I want
      to go to Paris for a while. My husband is buried there, you know.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXVI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N the morning of
      the fourth day after the meeting of Dora and Kenneth Galt, old Stafford
      was stirred to its outskirts by the return of the most popular young man
      who had ever lived in the town. Fred Walton got in an hour or so before
      noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had sent a telegram to his father announcing his coming, but had failed
      to mention the hour of his arrival, and so there was no special conveyance
      at the station to meet him, though old Simon, in his Sunday frock-suit and
      a fresh collar, with a five-cent shoe-shine and a ten-cent shave at the
      barber-shop adjoining the bank, sat in the counting-room waiting, not sure
      whether his son would get in during the morning or by the afternoon train.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not long kept in doubt, for the electric trolley-car that whizzed
      up from the station was fairly packed with individuals of both sexes and
      all classes, who, it seemed, had ridden up chiefly that they might be
      among the first to pay tribute to their old favorite and hear him talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all joyous and reassuring enough to Fred at first, and might have
      continued so had the car not stopped at a crossing half-way between the
      station and the square, and taken on Wynn Dearing, who, having returned
      home, had been visiting a patient near by. The eyes of the two met. Fred
      colored high; but with a hard, grave countenance Dearing simply turned to
      the conductor, paid his fare, and sat down near a window, through which he
      stared stonily all the way to the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heart of the returning exile sank into a veritable slough of despair.
      His admirers, packed about him, were stilled for a moment by the &ldquo;cut&rdquo; he
      had received, and then, not being able to interpret it, they valiantly
      passed it over, and showed by their excessive cordiality that if one of
      his old companions had been coarse enough to snub him on that day of all
      days, they remained true.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the light and joy of it all was blotted out for the one most
      concerned. He sat trying to answer the innumerable questions, trying to
      return humorous sallies and references to the gay old days with smiles
      that would reflect their good-will, but it was a poor effort at best. He
      endeavored, in a miserable maze, to recall the exact words of his father's
      hurried letter ordering him home, and his spirits sank lower and lower as
      he made the effort. After all, he told himself, he had misunderstood
      Margaret's message&mdash;the message which had raised him to the very
      skies of delight. The letter, which he had read hundreds of times, was in
      the pocket of his coat, and he could feel its now grim and satirical
      pressure against his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told me she wanted to see you,&rdquo; old Simon had written, &ldquo;and for me to
      write you so. She said she was sure when you and her got together you and
      her would understand each other perfectly. She was powerful flushed and
      excited, and I could hardly make out just what she did or did not mean. It
      was the way she <i>acted</i> more than what she actually said in so many
      plain words that made me believe she had concluded to let bygones be
      bygones. So, if I was you, Fred, and still thought she would be a proper
      mate, why, I should lay business aside and make hay for a while. The sun
      seems shining up this way for you right now, and so, as I say, I would
      come right on before some other cloud rises. Women are changeable, and she
      may be no exception to the rule. I can't quite understand why she shut off
      my proposition in your behalf when I went up to see her, and then come
      down all in a tilt and hustle the next day, and did what she did, and
      talked like she did. I am too much of a business man by habit, I reckon,
      to encourage anybody in a deal that ain't fully closed, signed, sealed;
      and delivered; so, you see, all I can say is to come on and work out your
      own salvation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, sure that he had made a grave mistake, and with the heaviest of
      hearts, Fred left the car at the postoffice, noting that Wynn Dearing,
      with a hard, set face, was striding across the street to his office with
      never another look in his direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is furious because I have come back,&rdquo; Fred said to himself. &ldquo;I
      promised him I'd stay away, and I have broken my word. General Sylvester
      is as much against me as ever, and so is Wynn. It is all up. I'll never
      live it down. These persons who seem glad to see me have nothing at stake,
      or they would snub me too. My father has forgiven me, but that has nothing
      to do with Margaret. After he wrote as he did, I hoped&mdash;hoped&mdash;well,
      I was a fool! I hoped too much. I'll go back West and stay there. I'll see
      Wynn Dearing and tell him of my mistake. Surely that will justify me if my&mdash;my
      presumption ends there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he neared the bank he saw his father standing in the door, backed up by
      all his clerks. The gaunt, grizzled visage of the old man, under its
      half-sheepish look, was lighted up as it had never been in his son's
      memory, and the faces around him were wreathed in welcoming smiles, but it
      was a hand of lead that Fred extended, a smile that was dead lay on his
      handsome face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dearing, to his surprise, on reaching his office after leaving the car,
      found Margaret waiting for him. He stared at her almost fiercely for a
      moment; then, as she avoided his eyes and was silent, he broke out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come down here to see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, brother,&rdquo; she answered, simply. &ldquo;I want to be among the first to
      welcome him home. He has suffered enough, and has proved his genuine
      nobility. I can't explain everything just now, for I have no right to; but
      you will know all that I know very, very soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know this, Madge,&rdquo; he said, and he sat down before her, looking like a
      figure carved in stone, so ghastly pale and rigid was he. &ldquo;I know <i>this</i>:
      if you pardon that man for what he has done, I'll never speak to you
      again. I can stand some things, but I can't stand that. No man can marry
      my sister who has stamped <i>the very heart out of my life, as this one
      has!</i> Now, perhaps you understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, brother, you mean that you love&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, and his head sank to his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must listen to <i>me!</i>&rdquo; Margaret began. &ldquo;But, no, you will
      have to wait&mdash;I can't tell you even now&mdash;I can't explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture there was a step on the floor of the front room. Some one
      was approaching. It was a messenger boy with a telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dearing took it and tore it open. The letters on the yellow sheet swam
      before his eyes, but he read the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Kenneth and I are married; now you will understand everything. We are
      all going to New York, then to Paris for a while. With love from mamma,
      Lionel, and myself, good-bye. Dora.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret had read the telegram over her brother's shoulder, and with a
      woman's tact she signed the boy's book and led him to the outer door. She
      stood there alone for several minutes, looking out into the street. There
      was no sound in the office. She waited ten minutes, and then, with a tear
      of sympathy in her eye, she went back to her brother and put her arms
      about his bowed form.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as was practicable, Fred led his father away from the clerks back
      to the old man's office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wynn Dearing refused to speak to me on the car as we came up,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Father, I am afraid I misunderstood your letter, and have made an awful
      fool of myself by coming. He will think, and his sister will think&mdash;&rdquo;
       But Fred could go no further. He sank into a seat near the desk, and the
      banker slowly lowered himself into his revolving chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say Wynn&mdash;you say her brother wouldn't speak to you,&rdquo; he
      faltered. &ldquo;Now, I wonder if&mdash;I&mdash;I wonder&mdash;You see, I hardly
      knew what to think when she popped in here like she did that day. What she
      said was all so jumbled and roundabout that, as I wrote you, it was more
      the way she <i>acted</i> that made me draw my conclusions than her exact
      words on <i>any</i> direct line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how did she <i>act?</i>&rdquo; Fred inquired, despondently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, if you <i>will</i> know&mdash;&rdquo; old Simon was growing red in the
      face. &ldquo;I had no idea of telling it even to <i>you</i>, but the truth is
      she up and kissed me&mdash;so she did! She gave me a smack right on the
      cheek!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She <i>kissed</i> you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what she did, by gum! And Toby come in just in time to make her
      let go of my neck. So, you see, after I thought it all over, why, I
      thought that maybe she regarded me as being a kin to her in some shape or
      other, and meant that as a sort o' hint of what she was willing to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a voice was heard in the corridor. It was Wynn Dearing's,
      and he was asking for Fred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if he's come here to pick a row,&rdquo; old Simon asked, as his
      startled eyes bore down on the face of his son. &ldquo;If he has, I reckon we
      can accommodate him. I ain't no fighter, but you are my own flesh and
      blood, and considering the time you've been away, and what you have
      accomplished, he hain't treated you right. Toby&rdquo;&mdash;raising his voice
      and going to the door and looking out&mdash;&ldquo;show that fellow back here.
      Nobody ain't hiding in this shebang, I am here to say, and if folks ain't
      satisfied all round&mdash;clean all round&mdash;why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Wynn Dearing was brushing past the old man through the narrow doorway,
      his face pale, his hand extended to Fred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done you a great wrong, old man,&rdquo; he said, in a shaking voice,
      &ldquo;and I have come to beg your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's all right, Wynn,&rdquo; Fred gasped, in surprise. &ldquo;I am sure you
      have treated me no worse than I deserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I have, Fred. I have worked against you ever since you left, and
      I now find that you are wholly innocent of what I accused you of. Let me
      talk it over with your father. Margaret is waiting at my office to see
      you. I promised I'd send you to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As if in a dream, Fred hastened out of the bank and went down to Dearing's
      office. No one was in the front, but he found Margaret in the back room
      standing at a window, looking out. She turned as he entered and gave him
      both her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm so glad&mdash;so glad!&rdquo; she cried, and he saw tears on her
      lashes, and the handkerchief she held in one of her hands was damp. &ldquo;Oh,
      Fred, we have all treated you so badly, so cruelly, so unjustly, when you
      were striving so hard! A great mistake was made. If I had known what I now
      know when we met in New York, I would never have treated you as I did. You
      were thinking of one thing and I of another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand,&rdquo; he said, groping for her meaning, his big, honest
      eyes dilating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I can't explain,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It really doesn't matter, anyway. I
      don't want even to think about it&mdash;at least to-day, when I am so
      happy. But I want you to know one thing: you see, Dora Barry showed me the
      letter you wrote her, and I want you to know that I love you. I have loved
      you every day, every minute, since you left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You love me&mdash;you really care for me?&rdquo; he said, deep in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but come walk home with me, dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want you all to
      myself. I shall never get my own forgiveness for allowing myself to
      misjudge you as I did. Let's not talk about it, but come on. Wynn may be
      back in a moment, and I don't want any explanations now, anyway. I want
      you wholly to myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they walked down the quiet street side by side he tried to speak, but
      the happiness within him had risen to a storm, and he could only stare at
      her in silent wonder, as if doubting his own good-fortune.

    <h2>
      CONCLUSION
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>NE of the great
      ocean bound steamships was ready for sailing from the New York harbor. On
      the deck, near the stern, somewhat removed from the others and leaning
      against the railing, stood a man and a child and a young woman so
      beautiful and so richly clad that the eyes of many of the passengers and
      their friends, who had massed themselves on the pier below, were fixed
      upon her admiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is going to be a glorious voyage, darling,&rdquo; Kenneth Galt said, as he
      stroked the golden hair of the child. &ldquo;The bay is as smooth as glass. Look
      how the people are staring at you! You cannot dream how beautiful you are.
      Are you happy, Dora?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked down at the water, put her hand against the cheek of the child,
      and smiled, a far-off look in her eyes. &ldquo;Think, oh, think of what it means
      to <i>him!</i>&rdquo; Just then Mrs. Barry came from the luxurious suite of
      state-rooms Galt had secured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one has sent a great bunch of flowers,&rdquo; she said to her daughter.
      &ldquo;They were addressed to you. I asked the florist's man who sent them. He
      said he didn't know, but that it was a telegraphic order from somewhere.
      Go see them; they are simply beautiful. They perfume the whole place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the three together, Dora went to the suite of rooms. In the one
      reserved for her, on a table, she found a great mass of damp, fresh roses.
      The card accompanying the gift had slipped down between the stems. She
      drew it out and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bon voyage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was all. She sat down at the table, gathered a bunch of the flowers
      in her hands, and buried her flushed face in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, and then she burst into tears. &ldquo;Bon voyage! bon voyage!
      From you&mdash;dear, dear, dear Wynn! I know. I understand. I have known
      and understood for years. I shall know and understand&mdash;always!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The signal for leaving had sounded. She felt the ponderous throb of the
      ship under her. She dried her eyes and walked out on the deck. Her husband
      came to meet her. He took her arm, and they leaned over the railing and
      looked down into the multitude of waving hats and handkerchiefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who sent the flowers, darling?&rdquo; Galt asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no name attached,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Look, Kenneth! Lionel is
      trying to climb the railing&mdash;don't let him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galt hurried away to do her bidding, and she gazed down into the water,
      which was being churned into white foam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bon voyage!&rdquo; she said, bitterly. &ldquo;Bon voyage!&rdquo;
     </p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
